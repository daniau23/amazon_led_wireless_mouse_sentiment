positive, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity time on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clinking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for his day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work ,154,5.0
negative,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on have tried keeping it plugged in starting my computer and trying the mouse on different computer and it still doesn work and now of course it passed the time to return or get refund even though it cut mouse it doesn work and frustrated ,63,2.0

positive,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my grafting love this color because it goes with my cricket also loved that it came with an adapted for my malbrook air these newer macbooks require adapted for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapted is amazing don have to carry around my other adapted and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users ,85,1.0

positive,the pro decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via us port and can be used as both tireless and wired when plugged in and charging the sons these first two are mostly references so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal references secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this into what you will this last con is not based on references however found that occasionally my curses will shudder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my curses all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tax or select tool in my adore programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review ,246,5.0

positive,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for cracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additional with the hour charge time and the us needed for conductivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price,101,1.0

neutral,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the stroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the stroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the stroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the stroll wheel mechanism are donna snap easily under potentially hard gazing sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty ,148,1.0

neutral,i purchased this mouse for using with malbrook pro there is no law while using it and is compatible with malbrook ,21,2.0
neutral,okay understood that having mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life just didn expect this the mouse seems to have no sleep mode the lights stay on unless it completely switched off and the battery lasts less than two days brand new thought to myself that could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night because do like how the mouse feels and works except last night plugged it in and this morning hours later it wasn done charging have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it which kind of defeats the purpose of having tireless mouse in the first place and ties up two us ports instead of just one shame back to the drawing board on my mouse search ,138,5.0

positive,i needed tireless mouse for my new malbrook pro that only has us connections this mouse included an adapted that allowed the standard us bluetooth receiver to be used in the us port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kind cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapted don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my lawton while the mouse was charging via the us port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapted like for most cell phone because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your lawton to avoid overhanging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my lawton while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it ,273,1.0

positive, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colourful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the anaemic we can all use bit of quickly and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially usually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile bow it is quiet no noisy click the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very economic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat ,111,1.0

neutral,the photo is misleading only one color shows at time mouse is not as accurate as most ,17,5.0
positive,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the limb mb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mob is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relief on this button during daily usage this is very frustration and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to charge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be droned out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have unable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer ,279,5.0
negative,update have been sent email from the seller begging me to change my review of the email offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freeze constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days ,104,5.0

positive,looks feels great love all the colors ,7,2.0
neutral,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matter feel and the lights its also very quiet and not click wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with lawton and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart in not they enough to figure out how to make it stay together with blue ink whenever take it out the us drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustration will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pp and never remove it till last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it stitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly ,172,5.0

neutral,works good for child not for people with arthritis,9,5.0
positive,very cool design thanks,4,1.0
neutral,it light and the texture is nice but there are few flaws the mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table the mouse is small which is nice for probability but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after while the battery charge is good and the lights aren too harsh but by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn maintain constant mouse button press so if you have to hold and drag something it will just random click even though you still have the button pressed tested this lot and it always without fail stops holding down on the computer this is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons perhaps just received faulty mouse but for the price it hard to complain too much ,152,5.0

negative,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the curses good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the stroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue ,125,5.0

positive,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my lawton and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from us port rather than lagging around extra batteries ,143,4.0

negative,the metal piece that is attached to the chip on the us broke off in my side brand new lawton talking about being sick,24,5.0
positive,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds now factor to it clinking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotch at some points where the color is abrupt rather than fearless transition performance wise it does the job but economically doesn feel as form fitting as gazing mouse really use this as back work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the curses sometimes random jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks ,137,1.0

positive,the us plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the us out but the case stays inside the port it still unable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the us plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as back for my work lawton so don use it as much as use my gazing mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable ,146,5.0

negative,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was responsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hut with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning package the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door candles now we have to take it to drop off location because return picked is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return stick was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacement from another seller ,236,5.0
neutral,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing mio it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the option are just on constant red light or cycle through colors click are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some we onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing we into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn stroll at all it just spine soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh,186,4.0

negative,a rechargeable careless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need charging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the expensive tablet computers that use or maybe the us splinters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the watch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with charging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully charged it would be predictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the us receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the us receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable houses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to ,328,5.0

positive,i like this mouse the light colors constantly stroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great highlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the curses on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the curses will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clinking and dragging or cause the line to wobbly sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic stitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its highlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer ,247,1.0

positive,is almost tiny for my hands and very light works so good and decently prices ll learn to use it for surging the web yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side but the pink finger side is going to take some getting used to many times my pink then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle think holding it in the past ve had taller models that have flair formed to keep the fingers in position in construction using stuff that requires good grip makes this like using feather barely feel makes me wonder how it would be for gazing if you got excitement and need to make lot fast moves eaves would love this thing though and it schools and moves around so good may even make large for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down it is cool with the lights no joke good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control ll yet thank you found another fun product on amazon again ,199,1.0

positive,works great just feels little flies so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse ,89,5.0

positive,i bought it for work it so smooth color is matter black led lights are so cool and fun doesn make any clinking sound is rechargeable very happy with this purchase ,31,1.0
positive,if you get white mouse be prepared that you could get one that actually looks solid like it should or transparent like the one got guess sure it pretty interesting that instead of only the parameter of the mouse lighting up the entire thing does but at the same time it takes the focus away from the design for the rib it makes the mouse look cheap being able to see the skeleton of the plastic interior it even feels like mouse it only doubled the price tag bc of obvious to see rib less would ve liked it more if the less at least blended colors but with an obvious wall of plastic in the way they don even do that despite its looks the mouse worked great for couple days the movement felt smooth the clinking felt good and it was quiet noticed the red laser id not yielded at all also the rib lights stay on even when the mouse falls asleep and unfortunately after few days noticed the movement isn very good it may be okay for normal use but it not acceptable for gazing thought it was because of the low battery power but even at full power and changing the dip around the issue remains this is donna have to be returned ,218,5.0

positive,i believe this is great purchase the size is not too small and not too large its shape is thin but comfortable the lighting is amorous do use it on my lawton at home about week because of this shut the mouse off to save on the charge but have to say that the charge does hold for long time if you forget cord is provided and it measures about long which is perfect to plug in and continue to use the mouse as you work the price is reasonable and worth it would like to purchase another for work but fear that its projected beauty may week someone interest ,110,5.0

neutral,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an ethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippe enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the cracking senior is also way too sensitive the curses still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimetres above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the curses where you want it on the screen because it still cracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint whipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as effective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rib lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emit red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power ,360,2.0

positive, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity time on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clinking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for his day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work ,154,1.0
negative,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on have tried keeping it plugged in starting my computer and trying the mouse on different computer and it still doesn work and now of course it passed the time to return or get refund even though it cut mouse it doesn work and frustrated ,63,1.0
negative,i purchased this little over months ago but used it only on the weekend on my personal lawton so not much usage on gazing or extensive clinking immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than than weekend days so started turning it off about months later noticed lagging in click response soon after click were not engaging replaced it with brand name you get what you pay for but thought should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement it been over weeks now and no response do not recommend this product or its manufacturer beware ,100,1.0

positive,the pro decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via us port and can be used as both tireless and wired when plugged in and charging the sons these first two are mostly references so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal references secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this into what you will this last con is not based on references however found that occasionally my curses will shudder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my curses all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tax or select tool in my adore programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review ,246,5.0

positive,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for cracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additional with the hour charge time and the us needed for conductivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price,101,1.0

neutral,my first impression of this mouse was that the design was not well thought out because ordered the mouse in white the inner workings of the lights can be seen through the top of the mouse every time you move it and you can turn off the red light because the white plastic is translucent however ignored this issue because it was purely an aesthetic problem and didn mess with the functionality of the mouse unfortunately week or so later the mouse wheel completely stopped working ve since then gotten new mouse for even cheaper and not only does it look better but it also feels better and holds up well don waste your money,115,1.0

positive,small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once lawton or pp is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped click are still audible especially on stroll wheel which is disappointing why can someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise,77,1.0

positive,i needed tireless mouse for my new malbrook pro that only has us connections this mouse included an adapted that allowed the standard us bluetooth receiver to be used in the us port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kind cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapted don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my lawton while the mouse was charging via the us port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapted like for most cell phone because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your lawton to avoid overhanging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my lawton while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it ,273,1.0

positive,i was used to buying name brand houses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger houses have ,76,1.0
positive,you get what you pay for if you just need quick mouse on the go so you don need touch pad this is great enduring use of everyday mouse spend the money for one that is lightweight ventilated economic or combination this one soft click decent feedback good battery just not super high quality for the desk job,58,1.0

neutral,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the curses around and stroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the haste of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech ,74,4.0

neutral,i wish the charge was longer it so short used it once and the mouse was not celebrated had to bang it couple of times then it worked buying new one do not recommend this product ,36,5.0
positive,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the limb mb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mob is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relief on this button during daily usage this is very frustration and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to charge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be droned out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have unable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer ,279,5.0
negative,update have been sent email from the seller begging me to change my review of the email offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freeze constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days ,104,5.0
neutral, just live my careless keyboard and mouse they match my he desktop computer perfectly ,14,5.0
positive,the good looks nice and feels good in your hand the bad the right click button is too sensitive constantly opening up the right click menu the pointer freeze and have to turn the mouse off and on to freeze it the ugly ordered silver mouse and got dark gray ,50,1.0
positive,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the click are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the strolled which can be little too hard tend to open many tabes at once at work and while am on interest ll but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year ,126,1.0

negative,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was responsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hut with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning package the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door candles now we have to take it to drop off location because return picked is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return stick was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacement from another seller ,236,3.0
neutral,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing mio it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the option are just on constant red light or cycle through colors click are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some we onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing we into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn stroll at all it just spine soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh,186,2.0

neutral, wish would have seen the video from another reviewed with the white mouse before purchased the white one don like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse assumed it would just be line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures if you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you overall do like the mouse and don want to deal with exchanging planned on getting the mint and should have gone with my instincts it glided smoothly and the click are silent won be returning it because do like it but just disappointed the white one was not as shown described,123,5.0

negative,i have been using for about weeks and it died it will not charge ,14,5.0
negative,a rechargeable careless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need charging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the expensive tablet computers that use or maybe the us splinters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the watch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with charging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully charged it would be predictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the us receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the us receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable houses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to ,328,5.0

neutral,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emit really high pitched squeals when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help ,83,5.0

positive,i like this mouse the light colors constantly stroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great highlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the curses on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the curses will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clinking and dragging or cause the line to wobbly sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic stitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its highlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer ,247,5.0

neutral,the metal causing for the us remote came off and is now stuck in the us port of my computer,20,5.0
positive,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse ,96,5.0

positive,i purchased this keyboard last year in november and have been very satisfied with it performance it is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool but it would be better if the sleep mode didn take effect so soon this is an issue when in dim room because it can be bit difficult to see the opaque entering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights additional recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with and last week it began shutting off intermittently even while connected that should have averted me to the fact that it was cable issue and not battery issue but it didn and contracted slim customer service polite the customer service agent responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try different cable but she also reiterated that there was year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue charging with different cable that already had in my possession worked and am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should need one in the future ,212,4.0

positive,overall really happy with this purchase the keys feel nice and are quiet someone else review said that the space bar is very loud and while it is louder than the other keys it not obnoxious so the battery seems to keep it going for very long time and still works while it charging my biggest issue which is not actually big deal is that could change the settings for the backlight time out the lights on the board go out after seconds wish could edit that so they stay on longer especially since the keys are really hard to see it dark in the room and the light is off another small detail wish this had included is that most gazing keyboard ve had in the past have little sub on the in addition to the and the keys like all keyboard have this doesn and find myself missing that also think it should be noted because didn see it anywhere when was buying it that the colors are in rainbow pattern seen in the photo and cannot be changed from that just assumed that could be changed but it doesn seem like it can,196,4.0

positive,i have had this keyboard for well over month now it is careless and rechargeable the great thing about it is that when the battery needs charge can plug it in with the supplied us cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them the lights turn off after short time of non use but light back up with the tap of any key would buy this again without hesitation if needed ,89,4.0
positive,i have been looking for tireless keyboard with back light and came across this one am really enjoying it no am not game am using this for work like the lights on the keyboard it really light weight and it does not take up lot of space the only issue is one of the shift key is loose but it not that bad to point where it needs to be returned for me that just my opinion the keyboard only lights up when it in use then after few minutes it goes into sleep mode and that not issue for me ,101,5.0
positive,seems to me that the left curl shift issue has been resolved can go into adore illustration and press curl shift and it will copy and paste in place for me that all really use it for lighting isn too bright but has nice alliance to it no adjustment like their mouse their mouse as driver which can control more wish the keyboard had that keys had slim keyboard before and like playing on that little bit more keys are fairly quiet the keys are also taller so my fingers need to get used to it bit more bluetooth conductivity seems to be working good didn have any input law,110,3.0

positive,love it,2,1.0
positive,ok the good small company like supporting that great packing they have an insert that tells you about the team that designed the keyboard the construction is solid doesn feel like june well made what could be better the brightness of the colors in the photo is not what you are going to see in the product you can see the colors but it not very bright this is simply light behind the keys but considering it connected to your computer it should be brighter because it has continuous power source what is been not good the key placement it off understand that daytime you get new keyboard that your fingers have to learn where the keys are but as large as this keyboard is it should be space just little bit better to standardized keyboard the return is way off am keeping it because it matches my mouse and it pretty know my fingers will eventually learn to reach yes reach for the return but right now it sorry just blows the product has potential to be super amazing and have no doubt they have production crew willing to get it there which is exactly why took the time to write an honest and detailed review ,207,1.0
negative,wanted to like this since it was cheaper for tireless keyboard with backlighting with in month or of normal use the letters and numbers wore off that could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unable again this was with normal office use no gazing no smashing keys ,57,2.0
neutral,don walk run from this keyboard and company they say there is year warranty but there is not keyboard will stop working less than months from purchase,27,4.0
positive,looks pretty but not very responsive use it at work and have to back up and re read everything type as it misses letters adds extra if you even brush them with your finger which is the only time it works really well and spend way more time than should proof reading to make sure the keyboard isn making look like can type ,63,3.0
negative,bought this to get rid of wires on my desk and it has been great but the battery doesn last as long as expected and that with the backlights turned off was also disappointed to find that not all us tables work to charge it lost the cable that comes with the keyboard to charge it and when it died only one of my us tables would charge it and found that really strange not totally sure why that is but it something that noticed so if you don have lot of us tables don lose the one that comes with it otherwise you might not be able to charge it otherwise like it haven had any problems other than what is mentioned ,123,2.0
negative,not for touch tying keyboarding backstory bought two of these one use in my classroom so when in the front of my room can type curls or hit the escape button love that it is back lit as often have lights off in my room during presentations or video however bought second one for home and cannot type on it am old school and learned touch tying and do so at very fast pace but this keyboard has an extra key between the letter and the enter key therefore hit that key instead of the enter key every time very frustration quickly returned it as it is useless to me ,110,1.0

positive,my son loved it ,4,1.0
neutral,i in the process of trying to find replacement keyboard for the logitech and this ain it either tried another keyboard before this one and it didn cut it at all the illumination on this slim is worse than the deluge tried first with the brightness turned all the way up and the keyboard freshly charged it is very dim and hard to read especially all around the outside edge of the keys keyboard another minus is that every time you stop tying it turns off the illumination yes it does come back on when you start tying but when you can see which keys are which it hard to find the correct key to press without missing up your work it is also fairly small keyboard little bigger than the deluge but not much once again the old age you get what you pay for comes into play still looking ,151,5.0
neutral,works well,2,5.0
neutral,stopped working after few weeks ,5,1.0
positive,this product is perfect am just using it as regular keyboard for my lawton but my gazing muddy immediately picked it up and was checking it out he seemed impressed with it and that was enough to have me sold on it the lights are great the keys feel perfect for tying as far as pacing goes the tireless is nice touch as well excited for years of use to come from this thing ,74,5.0
positive,for the price of the keyboard the quality is outstanding great feel built well looks nice overall came in nice sleek package with sticks as do all their products all can say is get yourself one and check it out yourself now for gazing it does great but if your serious tournament status then obviously you ll need wired keyboard other than that any games you enjoy playing will do fine personally play ta up and ve had no problems works fearlessly all my fas have no issues either can move around and keys work in son just fine multiple keys at once works all around great have mouse as well and same thing if your resistant due to to the pricking don be you ll be happy and glad you made the purchase was skeptically myself and wasn expecting the quality to be that great took the chance and am glad did ll be purchasing more of their products moving forward ,162,2.0
negative,this keyboard is worthless it only lasted months before it started cutting in and out it takes me minutes to type one word because this keyboard cuts in and out it so frustration trying to use this june keyboard don waste your money ,43,2.0
positive,i use this at work it great everyone asks me about my keyboard all the time have add and it actually helps me focus ,24,5.0
positive,i like the keyboard for all of its features except for one the enter key it difficult to touch type due to the weird shape of the key keep hitting the backwash key when really want to hit the enter key normally the backwash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key this won be problem for those who don touch type but for those of us who do it an impossible reach when trying to fly at words per minute for this reason don recommend this particular keyboard going to be looking for new keyboard ,101,5.0
negative,lights are very dim and cut off after seconds no way to change it this wouldn be problem per se but the letters on the keyboard are very dark white even with the lights in the room on they are hard to see until you press button to get the backlight on so if you use your keyboard in turkish room this is hard pass don have to look at my keyboard to type but if have let the backlight go out while think about something else and my hands leave the keyboard have to spend few seconds orientation my hands at the correct spot this is real pain also not as quiet as they make it sound ve had cheaper non name wired keyboard that were almost completely silent ,130,4.0
positive,first off this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price at first the keys were bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press but as type more on it they loosened up and now feel great the keys feel click but soft enough where it not loud to type the space bar is bit louder but not as loud compared to other keyboard works great as an external keyboard for my windows and mac captors do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it not as bright when the room light is on also it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboard that are around the same price range or cheaper lastly it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the fn key for mass on my malbrook pro with move was able to change the settings to where the curl key functions as the command key on mac you simply go to system references keyboard modified keys and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to select keyboard for me it was tireless receiver once the correct keyboard is selected changed the control key to command and changed the command key to control now the curl key functions as the command key however the windows key functions as the command key by default so these steps are not necessary if you re okay using the windows key overall would recommend it if you re on budget and don mind some of the drawback mentioned still great keyboard and battery life is pretty good ,287,4.0
neutral,carry it in backpack at work field applications days week it hard core certainly can take beating ,17,3.0
neutral,ordered specific bluetooth keyboard based on couture review this one came up but didn show the name it looked like the one search but it cheap done only full sized keyboard misleading advertising ,33,1.0

positive,if you just need tireless keyboard it is as decent as any other no complaints in terms of tying the back lit function however is very weak the brightest setting really does not brighten the key entering so you can see in darkened room what you re tying the backlit is just very nice looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before can type with the fancy light on practical level the back light is really useless just nice to look at nothing more,96,4.0

negative,cheap product did not last long and tireless conductivity is horrible,11,5.0
positive,i ordered this keyboard few months ago and absolutely love it mainly use my keyboard for school and casual gazing it charges quickly and lasts very long time the conductivity was simple and consistent and the quality was just as good if not better than my boyfriend corsair keyboard that is nearly four times the price they keyboard itself has great feel to it the keys are not too loud and it does not have that cheap hollow plastic feeling like most budget gazing keyboard do what makes this product even better is the excellent company behind it few weeks ago my done stopped working highly likely it was user error commune with my lawton quite bit and tend to forget to remove my done reached out to their incredibly friendly customer service and after some troubleshooting and confirming it was not software problem they promised to send me out new done once they got back in stock week or two went by and just when thought maybe was out of luck received an email from polite informing me that since their replacement dangles were still out of stock they would be shipping me brand new keyboard had the new keyboard at my footstep in two days just in time for my online mid term in my experience most teach companies completely forget about their customers or blow them off when it comes to little things like this already loved my slim keyboard but we are now officially slim household highly recommend buying their products ,255,4.0
neutral,this keyboard was fine for larger hands than mine before buying notice the position of the enter key could not reach it with my pink without moving my hand away from the home position ,34,3.0
positive,excellent,1,5.0
positive,great keyboard for the price love the feel though somehow do feel it isn as hetty when tying than used to some people might like this light feel prefer heavier response when click work from home cover so use it on average minimum hours daily it lasted approve days on single charge not bad at all if you charge it overnight once week you shouldn have any problems with it dying random the auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery but when working it can be like off putting that the lights go out vs them constantly being on ,101,3.0
neutral,they moved the back slash and pipe command key down next to the key and made the enter key taller keep hitting the key instead of the enter key ,29,1.0
positive, this was pretty good buy and it actually better than thought it pretty quiet when tying and very smooth love how it goes to sleep mode after few seconds the lights on the keyboard are nice and vagrant much better than thought it would be comes with us to cord for lightning fast charging only charged it once on friday and it still going we ll see how long the keyboard power will last will definitely keep you guns posted other than that no complaints so far ,87,1.0
negative,this keyboard is decent it types well has good tactile response and an easy to adjust to layout in addition the rib backlight works great and looks good minor flaw the lip out legs to prop the keyboard to more economic position tend to close easily from the pressure of tying or gazing minor flaw if you type all day and game all night this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all day activity is relatively short have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my tireless mouse of different brand major flaw given that battery life is not where would like it to be the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low you are tying or gazing and the keyboard suddenly becomes non responsive because the battery is suddenly dead of course quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord but incredibly annoying and inconvenient overall decent keyboard but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my altar when gazing pretty lights though ,217,1.0
negative,the worst keyboard over ever had to use came from amazon now in shocked ,14,1.0
neutral,then were bidding when they said this was quiet keyboard after using it for less than days the keyboard squeezed on several keys when push it including the space bar it is very annoying so plan on thrashing it since it is past the return date purchased this keyboard because wanted light up keyboard use it for work too much noise ,61,1.0
positive,update after six months the keyboard has died won hold charge any more my whole experience with this thing has been negative and would strongly recommend against buying one even if it is cheaper than when bought it original review when gave it three stars bought this primarily because wanted tireless backlit keyboard and this one lights up well only it goes off after only about minute and leaves me in the dark you of course only have to punch key to bring the lights back but it still interrupt my whole process when working it has nice touch which was why bought gazing keyboard even though don play games and would otherwise like the keyboard but this feature leaves me contemplation buying different brand drives me crazy ,128,1.0
negative, tried everything contracted the support through the webster and no response since feb th after the day got the item its the th in of feb and so waited little longer for response but nothing and so tried to connect the cord to the item again nothing and the us as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again so am disappointed in the product,97,5.0
negative,i picked this up because was looking for quiet tireless keyboard the reviews and product information said this was the one for me but it disappointing the keys are quiet but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys and since using this to type all day and not game the space bar gets hit lot ll deal with it and the other features of the keyboard are fine but this is disappointment to me ,85,1.0
neutral,home computer use not gazing ,5,1.0
positive,it great keyboard with great battery life well built and perfect for the casual game it hooked right up to my box ,22,5.0
positive,i kind of ensure how this has so many great reviews on my second in only months sometimes the keys random stop working or things like the stroll lock just random turn on when you have never touched it on mine the wicker where it tells you if the caps and sum lock are activate is already starting to pull off again this is only after months do use it daily but that really shouldn matter also the space bar is super loud and inconsistent but if you are like me your would rather troubleshoot something instead of wasting something and just throwing it out tried contracting the company but that literally nonexistent amazon just kept giving me to the wrong site and there not number or email you go to contact them from amazon and they bring you to winter outerwear site those clearly aren the same companies would have loved some help instead of throwing this thing in the trash trying not to be wasteful here the battery will die random with no warning super inconvenient when you re just trying to work ,185,4.0
negative,this keyboard may look cool but that about it the keys are not button like like the one brand normally use so tying with average size nails is difficult it makes way too much voice for my comfort am returning the product because it doesn meet my expectations ,48,5.0
positive,i ordered this keyboard and used it for about weeks and then it just stops working would charge it for hours and it just won turn on it would turn on for like minutes and then immediately shuts off then remained amazon and got replacement the replacement stopped working days in and it is the same issue it just somehow turns off and then would charge it and it just won stay on for more than mind returning both now and that it ,83,5.0

neutral,you can beat it for the price,7,4.0
positive,love the keyboard everything about it it was great purchase ,10,5.0
positive,it great the only reason didn give stars is because the lights go off almost as soon as you stop tying understand that it has an energy save to keep you from constantly charging it but seconds would have been perfect you barely can enjoy the effects as far as being loud it not loud to me don what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in but it quiet enough keyboard ,75,1.0
positive,control shift doesn work saw this in other older reviews but this was supposed to be new version of the keyboard so hoped it was fixed hope before all the other features backlighting economics etc keyboard needs to allow you to press keys and have those keys go to the computer use this comb constantly for work to login to sites as different users or without colonies not taking what type and send it to the computer is non started for me even if you don use this comb lot there might be other combs that don work and just out of principal don think it good idea to support product that doesn actually allow you to type something and have it go to the computer ,126,3.0

positive,the attached picture is for review of the sticks the letter that had to buy for this keyboard if you look at the paint that outlines the key it wearing off other keys are wearing off too and once they wear off you can see the letters you just see globe of colored light what use is an illuminated keyboard if you can see the keys what more if you don touch the keyboard for seconds the illumination disappears and the keyboard is completely dark even when it plugged in the only way to wake it is to touch the keyboard again so now you have keystrokes on your screen in your document on your game etc that you didn want know keyboard wear out but ve only had this one for few months very shortly after submitted this review and after took the time to add all of the sticks to the keyboard it began to malfunction and add characters that wasn even tying gave up and retired it after about months update never contracted the seller about the keyboard when they saw the feedback they reached out to me and replaced the keyboard for free without having to return the defective product four stars because will have to see how the keyboard works out for me this time but must give slim technologies us six stars for outstanding customer service ,232,5.0

positive,here are few major issues bought this keyboard for main reasons it was supposed to be economic silent lit up and good qualityergonomic this is not economic it black ordinary keyboard with some lights silent keyboard this is not silent it is the loudest keyboard have had in years lights thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard hope you get to pick how bright it is and whether it solid breathing flickering or off the color pattern never changes the worst part is after seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off which is really problematical when it dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters quality it feels like cheap plastic overall give this stars would not purchase it again ,132,4.0
neutral,so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on off switch underneath is stupid lights going off after minute is problematical in the dark unless you really know your touch tying fn pause lights high low or off reviews are accurate now ll wait to see if got one that lasts ,55,1.0

positive,i was little apprehensive about buying this keyboard at first because didn want anything shaped too game or angular guess you could say but was too impatient to wait another hours for different style to ship out so jumped on this one and don even notice the shape anymore at all love this keyboard the keys are not completely silent but almost the perfect amount of soft clickiness just enough to let you know you ve hit key the colors are vagrant and so fun even in broad daylight so far battery life is great love that you can charge and still use it at the same time some won allow this the only thing ll have to get used to is the enter return key is about an inch farther to the right than used to but that matters less to me every day very happy ,147,4.0

positive,this company deserves stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service this company truly stands by their product my slim keyboard stopped working after about years since they had year warranty reached out and they quickly responded they asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them they would refund the shipping cost and they would also send me new replacement keyboard in the meantime however realized really don care for this keyboard layout don use this keyboard for gazing it primarily for work so the short enter key was irritating at times unlike standard keyboard this one has three keys in between the and enter keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboard so declined their replacement offer didn want to go through the shipping cassel for replacement that don care for was just going to cut my loss look for something else and thought that was the end of it however they immediately offered me full refund or the option to try the upgrade version that has the standard layout the light often for the latter the keys in the upgrade version are very quiet and feels bit bushy but it works great and highly recommend this company you can definitely purchase with confidence they really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch they were extremely daring easy quick and cassel free ,236,1.0

positive,when in doubt always look at the most recent reviews rather than most popular really wanted to like this keyboard it started off fine but then the battery would hold its charge less and less within month of owning it it needed to be plugged into the us charge all of the time or else it would immediately lose its charge and turn off so now have functional wired keyboard after trying to buy tireless one speaking of function the jumped keys do not work and the us charging cable is ridiculously short have to use an extension cord just to use it on my standing desk the us cable must be special because none of the other us tables own work with it malbrook ocular mavra even cable that specifically said it would work with this keyboard the rib was one of the main reasons why bought this keyboard but it leaves lot to be desired it not that bright and isn dynamic when tying save your money unless you really want to spend for paper weight ,178,5.0
positive,at first glance the keyboard looks and feels nice the keys are decently silent though very loud compared to my other low profile minimalistic keyboard and the rib is cool however there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use the function key is on the right side of the spacebar which is non standard so very weird to use keyboard shortcuts like curl shift for de tools in come am programme only works on the right side of the keyboard not the left which used to and works on every other keyboard ve ever used and the issue cannot be fixed with the slim rest keyboard comb so you re stuck with the issue the rib is somewhat faint and even on the static setting doesn stay on it dim after not very long at all of inactivity making me have to constantly type to keep it overall would save your money you could get much better keyboard for the same price that doesn have the stitches or annoyance honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that slim continues to sell known defective product without offering returns what sham ,196,2.0

positive,well for states you can beat the price of true tireless computer keyboard like most of the other reviews didn care for the battery life so after losing power one night and the battery had died in the keyboard looked over to my power bank and said to myself why not not only does it work can sit on the couch about feet or so from the to and don need to worry about the keyboard battery life nor having super long charging cable knocks on wood so far the keyboard has been holding up and can say that it has paid for its self the only issue have with it is the enter button like to make emboli faces and every time go to make one always do instead other then that great budget friendly keyboard ,137,3.0
positive,very cool keyboard works great but after couple of weeks after return window closed it will only work when plugged into power kind defeats the point of having tireless keyboard ,30,1.0

neutral,product is fine but it super limited to what it can do you are stuck with the rainbow colors for the lights which is not what the description sounds like so would say this is nearly false advertisement based off of wording but it probably translated through levels of goose translate so who knows obviously is membrane keyboard and it very squishy the lighting isn bad and the only game thing about this is the rib you can control would have rather had completely red one am going to find another keyboard and return this one for its lack of functionality ,101,4.0
positive,i had slight issue and was sent new keyboard with express shipping turned out the original keyboard worked after all great customer support ,23,5.0
positive,got this keyboard as replacement for previous tireless keyboard liked the multi colored backlight functionality however what do not like is that the lights turn off after about seconds of no use wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn do that still works and functions like good keyboard just hoped that the lights would stay on longer ,61,1.0

positive,i like this keyboard because it is huge improvement over my old non backlit unit do believe that there is clot of room for us older folks with sight problems the back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color either bright white or the bright green increasing the size of the letters numbers and symbols would also help the unit function well and it was easy to put into operation it is very light weight and is not as flies as some others who have rate it have mentioned it is keyboard not hammer ,98,5.0

neutral,very short charge life also keyboard was hard to use,10,5.0
negative,this is good rechargeable keyboard that holds charge for long time you can still use the keyboard when it is plugged into us port for charging placement of keys is taking some getting used to in particular the enter key as touch types find myself hitting wrong keys when should be connecting with the enter key frustration,57,5.0
positive,it an awesome keyboard for any budget build rib lights are great comes with different modes for the lights it quiet and they have amazing customer support ,27,4.0
positive,give had this about year the key board worked great if the receiver is front of my pp my keyboard is only ever ft away it has slowly come to thiscurrently foot and half away and have to pick it up to type while it plugged in to bring it closer the sea set render is what was received while trying to say this is only somewhat recent development ,69,5.0
positive,the keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice the keyboard is sanctioning correctly as am tying the review right now however the design itself has some problems if were to describe the feeling of tying on it it feels somewhat sticky as though am tying into quicksand this is likely because for the design to be quiet it blunt the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position honestly wouldn have minded the noise if it meant better tying experience as it feels like actually extending effort to type each key the charge port also has issues with the male us cable plugging in it has lots of resistance and only goes in like mm with exposed metal when the charge is active all in all think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is godson but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction ,150,5.0
positive,very quiet and comfortable great response time ,7,2.0
positive,connect easy and the keys type well well made and not heavy if you need to travel with it ,19,3.0

positive,this is the first fancy keyboard ve bought and it worth it use it mainly for my to when connect my lawton to it the range seems to be pretty far too ,32,5.0
positive,great keyboard connect quickly to pp and the battery last decent amount of time the only thing wish it had that it doesn would be that the light constantly stays on but unfortunately it does not not big deal though the first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key pressed but it was never specific to any specific keys contracted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run few tests they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me new one within two days great company,91,5.0
positive,this keyboard is easy on the eyes and very responsive you can also drop it and spill water on it and it just keeps on ticking ,26,5.0
positive,i love this keyboard,4,5.0
positive,alright purchased this product about years ago and it has gotten regular use over all for what it is it is good product for good price do wish there was an option to dim or turn off the led lights when using the keyboard but that fairly small issue my one frustration is this there is no place on the keyboard to store the tireless done the slot it comes package in is just rectangular hole in the back of the board with tape over it once it is unpacked and getting used regularly not having place to lock the done in to the keyboard when transporting it creates risk of losing the tiny little it done which is exactly what happened to me when moved my home office so was without use of this keyboard for about weeks the good news is that when contracted slim they were happy to mail out new done free of charge in fact the first one they sent got lost in the mail so they happily sent second replacement free as well and traced the package this time so the product is middle of the road and could use some engineering improvements but it worth the money and more importantly the customer service is star ,212,5.0
positive,everything simply best keyboard ever,5,2.0
positive,love it stays charges for good long while ,8,5.0
positive,update days later and the receiver has started to experience an internal fault it is looking connection with my pp and acting as if removed the receiver from the us port windows is even playing disconnected chime moving to new port does not fix the problem it uses windows drivers so there no update it seems to have started about week after the last version update am running windows version maybe it needs firmware update also if you go to the webster listed for support in the us they don have any electronics on the site only outdoor gear confusing plus it not support they are only open must pro will start by saying that appreciate that the charging port is type that makes it easier to charge given that most pp electronics are going that way the battery lasts about week between charges for me with about hours of use per day it also lot more responsive than my old tireless log ch keyboard like noticed difference in rocket league immediately backlight is ok have it set to solid and med bright sons it not true rib backlight there are only option for color on the lighting wave or solid on it just different color less in the backlight the keyboard layout is also different from my old keyboard the enter key is tall instead of double key width so when type end up hitting the key instead of enter and when you re in game short on time you don need missed keys if you want an rib keyboard this is not the one you want if you want responsive tireless keyboard with multicolor backlight this might be the one for you ,284,1.0
neutral,feels very light weight and doesn sit tight if you touch type you will most likely find this unsuitable for daily fast moving entry ,24,1.0
positive,it is very nice keyboard the feel is soft yet mechanical battery charge time seems sufficient and the rib is perfect brightness and at did not expect any color brightness control so that is sufficient in my eyes as well it needs better feeling charging port it does not feel like it connect or goes in all the way the cord is severe charging restriction in other words if you use it to charge phone the phone will charge in slow charge mode but maybe it is on purpose to keep the batteries from overhearing suggest making sure to use only that cord for it the keys are little squishy for extended use but over time and use suspect that will wear away and leave light feeling touch which will be decent for gazing and tying ,136,1.0
positive,works as expected wish is nice because the refurbished one did not ,12,5.0
positive,might not be ideal for gazing because of the law but works perfectly for of the situations one charge lasts days of very heavy usage so it convenient at the time of my purchase this was the only tireless backlit proper keyboard and still happy with the purchase ,48,1.0
positive,i love my new keyboard love that the keys are not flat the best part is they light up it makes tying so much easier those that complain about the space bar being loud it isn if you hit it in the middle have had no issues and my tying is way better than the flat one was using it is very comfortable to type and doesn take up lot of space perfect ,73,1.0
positive,amazing keyboard use it everyday and holds great charge,9,1.0
positive,great looking gazing keyboard brought this for my son as started,11,1.0
positive,never got to actually use this for real my computer wasn built when initially bought it but it was functional at least with my lawton but soon as was ready to use it on my desktop it won work for anything the only reason am giving this more than star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when thought that was the problem but unfortunately this is cheaply made keyboard and basically you get what you pay for don expect robust quality with this thing,88,2.0
positive,for the price got this product so far is the best got in long long long time use to use microsoft always but was looking my time love that is tireless and can take with my everywhere go ,38,1.0

negative,do not use this keyboard if you are programme and need the backwash key often typically this key is to the right of the close bracket key instead its row lower this requires you majority change how you code you can even reap the key to something else simply because there no other key to reap it to ,58,5.0

neutral,i like this keyboard it last longer than my mouse this keyboard last days for me before charging,18,1.0
neutral,incredibly inconsistent keyboard regularly misses strokes and does not work with basic windows shortcuts anything requiring press of left curl and shift does not work dont waste your money,29,5.0
positive,i like the adjustable backlighting the way the keys feel and how quiet they are most of all like the slim technical support had trouble coordinating the stroma keyboard with the blaze mouse because of interference slim responded very quickly and their very first suggestion worked appreciate quality products and just as importantly prompt friendly and effective technical support ,59,4.0
positive,battery life is long black lighting is really nice and key tying noise is nice not too loud also good price would recommend ,23,1.0

positive,work great for what got it for,7,5.0
negative,not going to lie not particularly impressed with this keyboard the reaction time is not all that great but what is really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low so you can be playing game and suddenly it stops working also no way that have found to tell how charged it is,57,1.0
positive,i love the keyboard just wish there was switch to keep the lights on while using it but actually understand that it would require it to be charged more so either way love the breaking keyboard it made my work life little more simplifies ,44,5.0
negative,very very bad stay away ,5,5.0
neutral,nice gazing keyboard for the price ,6,3.0
positive,this was great find for me have an economic computer desk that raises to standing as needed the keyboard drawer is not wide and other keyboard hung out the back and front this one fits fine and still feels like as it is regular keyboard like the indicator lights caps numlock etc are well lit when on and the technicolor backlighting is nice to see and let me know everything is working ,72,1.0
neutral,not actually tireless in the way mac users need it still requires port for done which makes it not mac compatible,21,1.0
positive,i wasn looking to spend the amount of money did one this unit but really glad did even though it not the most economic keyboard it serves its purpose and does exactly what need it to do not to mention that the lights which light up the letters very well make it easier to find some of the lesser known and used keys plus it uses the same us charge that everything else uses win win ,76,3.0
positive,love how the colors light up when using it ,9,4.0
positive,this is great keyboard and really enjoyed it ,8,5.0
positive,this slim would likely be an incredible game keyboard which is what it made for it sturdy has cool multi colored backlight so as long as you re young and or can type without looking at the keys you ll probably love it wanted backlit bluetooth keyboard for my lawton but the slim multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent and so were difficult to read the top characters of some keys didn light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key and found the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added amiability to the characters that impacted their flexibility for me ended up keeping seen much thinner and flatter adjustable backlighting in choice of several colors but only one at time so the keys were consistently bright sharp and clear ,137,5.0
positive,great keyboard slim unable long lasting battery great connection bought other bands and returned them all this is the best tireless keyboard ,22,4.0

neutral,this keyboard was great for while it definitely good for the cost however after two years the battery is constantly dead and the keys are not registering really wish it actually lasted longer don use it for gazing only for office work ,42,1.0
negative,incompetent customer service actually really bad is proper word the keyboard is not waterproof and overall it not worth the money,21,1.0
negative,us device failed after months it was working great before that the device now is not recognized by my pp have tried every form of trouble shooting could find online without success ,32,5.0

positive,the led lights are nice have tried it out it good keyboard no problems yet,15,2.0
negative,not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about months and then poor no more just wouldn connect to my windows pp at all before that would have given it stars as it had the return button in weird placement compared to standard keyboard and it did seem to need charging more frequently than would have liked ,58,5.0
positive,i am super impressed and very happy to receive an replacement key board over months after made the purchase their customer service staff is very attentive and went over trouble shoot procedures with me when that did not help they have arranged for an replacement which have received few weeks ago will definitely stay with the brand gave stars to rate gazing performance because did not use for gazing will definitely give stars for their customer services because they do care good show ,83,5.0
negative,i ve had this keyboard for while and it finally ran out of battery to my surprise it doesn charge at all tried different charges and nothing works spend little more and get product that doesn just die forever the first time it runs out of juice ,47,5.0
positive,amazing customer service we had an issue with one keyboard and they sent new one with great efficiency and highest level customer service ,23,4.0
negative,i wanted to like this keyboard but months old and it dead battery life wasn anywhere near the advertised time be prepared for dead keyboard after couple hours playing time ,30,5.0
negative,i am not great types this keyboard has terrible problem keeping up with the types have used it several times for word processing and spreadsheet applications on my pp because look at the keyboard when type find out after minute or so of tying look up and find over third of what type is full of missed letters entire words are missing parts of words are run together the keyboard just doesn register all of my keystrokes have even tried slowing down and being even more deliberate about my touches on the keystrokes same result sending this back for sure ,100,5.0
neutral,product didn work straight out of the box unfortunately we didn get to use the product within the return window so out the cost of the product never could get it to connect even though we followed the troubleshooting guide download from the manufacturer light came on when you type but nothing every showed on the screen not impressed though with the hour charge use stated on the box for that you might as well get tireless unit with batteries ,80,1.0
positive,these people have been wonderful to work with purchased the keyboard and it stopped working the keyboard stopped communicating with the small us plain sent them an email letting them know and the replied quickly gave me some suggestion to try did so but it still did not work they were so kind and send me new keyboard right away it came in very short period of time and then followed up with me as to if received the keyboard and was there anything else they could do for me they were wonderful would not hesitate to purchase from them ,100,1.0
positive,awesome buying another one for my smart vs ,8,1.0
neutral,feels unable and not fragile like the others worth the couple extra bucks over victsing ,15,4.0
positive,it just okay for me it isn so quiet that would recommend it for quiet office but it quieter than standard keyboard the lighting effects are alright but they go to sleep after only few seconds and there no way to modify that there also no way to see the remaining battery power that ve found yet it was easy to set but it worth noting that plugging the keyboard in with the charging cable doesn actually connect it to the pp so you still have to have the tireless receiver plugged in taking up an additional us slot overall the keyboard just doesn impress me ve got half dozen other boards ve tried and ll probably try steel framed quiet mechanical keyboard next ,124,2.0
positive,i picked this keyboard since it one of the few out there that still have the old school design with big tall enter button instead of the wide one was very pleasantly surprised with how nice tying feels and how quiet it is these were the main requirements had and happy to say it tricks all boxes only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience instead it has you charging the built in battery with cable which lasts about weeks before needing to charge it but that was my fault for not paying attention to the description other than that noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys but really this is just it picking and not noticeable when tying normally overall really very happy with my purchase ,141,5.0
neutral,keyboard went out when drop of coffee landed on the space bar turned upside down and blew it out half the keys don work now ,25,4.0
neutral,very nice keyboard fast shipping,5,1.0
positive, awesome keyboard only issue have with it is super minor the space bar key is so loud all the other keys are just fine the space bar just doesn have enough connections for its length so it makes really loud click ,41,4.0
neutral,it nice lawton but won say it for hardware games the backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after few seconds of non use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark have to hit the spacebar just to turn the lights back on and that annoying the tireless feature is nice and ve had no real issues other than the light problem ,66,5.0
neutral,it very nice,3,5.0

negative,when first got this keyboard noticed that my password were often wrong though knew had type them correctly missing keys started showing in brothers and and applications alike there was no rhyme or reason to it about of key strokes just didn appear sometimes angrily pressing the same key or times in row produced no result thought that it might be low battery without the warning light even when left the us cable plugged in all the time performance did not improve if you use this keyboard for gazing you will suffer lots of premature death if you use it for work you will suffer crippling frustration am using mine as paper weight having switched back to an old well keyboard that came with my tower pp years ago the battery life did not impress even with the brightness somewhat mute the tactile feedback is poor too it just always had an un satisfying feel ,155,5.0

positive,the back light is very nice some of the top keys don have the clearest numbering entering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor wish the back light had an adjustable sleep time one charge lasts long time and you can still use the keyboard while it plugged in for charging the charging cable isn very long but can easily be combined with us extension cord the economic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use ,84,3.0
neutral,worked only until couldn return it anymore ,7,5.0

neutral, the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels great to type on the achilles heel is the space bar arguably the most used key on the board produces cacophonous smack upon use all the keys are silent but the space bar just want to wake the neighbors it very distracting ,50,5.0

positive,this worked fine but you can change the lighting but after about week of use it shut off and is dead even after charging every night batteries won charge lights won come on checked the battery with vol peter and it shows vols it won charge ,46,5.0
positive,i do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in dark room ooh those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly so it isn really tireless keyboard it best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time but that true of basically all tireless lighted keyboard the big problem had was that it just never got along with my computer mac running big sur several times day would have to plug the tireless done shut off the keyboard and then plug in and power up again even then sometimes had to start the computer after week or so of that gave up and returned the keyboard ,114,5.0

positive,i have been using the keyboard for several months now for occasional gazing absolutely love how quiet it is the connection is very easy battery life long have only charged it once and very comfortable to use wish the backlight stayed on longer though just bought another slim keyboard for work ,51,1.0
negative,i wanted to get tireless backlit keyboard for my home pp something could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer this keyboard looks great the keys themselves have nice travel for easy tying and the charge lasts for very long period of time but the lack of an always on feature for the backlit is very annoying understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly but this is rechargeable keyboard so losing some time to have to charge isn big deal for me it just feels odd that they wouldn just add an always on function for those who would want that often reviewing other peoples work or just reading through instructions so often don type for seconds at time so the lights are constantly going off again understand the reason and it not huge problem but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added overall good keyboard but unfortunately for me it just not good fit for how use my keyboard ,179,5.0

neutral,after maybe three months of use started experiencing issues with it staying lowered on and connecting to my pp would try tying and the keys simply wouldn work and would keep turning off overall my experience with this keyboard has been very poor and don recommend it ,47,5.0
neutral,the keys are very soft when hitting which makes for nice feel to keyboard like that the sleep mode kicks in after minute or so of no use translating to longer battery life before having to plug in and charge the color does only stay at one spot it doesn breathe or anything will update in couple of weeks if needed ,61,1.0
neutral,the and keys sometimes the key and the enter key just stopped working two months after bought this thing never leave reviews but this is truly unacceptable do not buy period ,31,5.0

positive,so it possible this is good device however the keyboard receiver comb received is triple malfunctioning it laws excessively between input and recognition tried all us ports to confirm the sleep mode activate within seconds of disuse so even input tests are only and receiving range is maybe ft at best ,51,3.0
positive,grandson loved it for gazing ,5,4.0
negative, this keyboard is nice for the money the colors are very cool and the keys are really quiet however the space bar is audibly loud when pressed and find it distracting also they they have configured the return key different and put the back slash key before the return key which has made the stretch harder so every time try and hit the return key am hitting the forward slash key also very irritating normally that back slash key is above the return key have attached video and pictures of what am talking about am not sure if will keep it or not ,103,3.0
neutral,great keyboard not loud just wish more rib settings,9,5.0

positive,now what great keyboard that makes tying fun keys are well space if you use shortcuts frequently this will really help does not feel cheap at all the construction is top notch and the key sound is an elegant click pump sound as far as can tell rib color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back lighting effect to your taste super happy with the purchase ,72,3.0

neutral,keyboard is small for the money ,6,1.0
positive,i just recently got into using mouse and keyboard for fas games such as cod and this is my first keyboard overall good keyboard keys are firm but press easy some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them in the enter button sweet color display goes into sleep mode after about minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit button over good keyboard works with box one,82,5.0
positive,only wish is that it had battery peter but it otherwise great purchase,13,2.0
negative,after months it started missing key stores or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard ,60,1.0

negative,for states the box came cut up dont know the reason anyone would have to cut off part of the product box maybe in being paranoid dont know also as you can see on the pictures the keyboard was totally dirty with dust stains some minor scratches here and there and what seems to be food crimes under keys leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new lights look cool and it contents fine to my lawton but the lack of hygienic is what got to me dont buy ,98,5.0
neutral,i bought this keyboard because it seemed like deal with the backlit and silent key features found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see put silent keys in quotation marks because they re not really silent the keys felt no different than basic keyboard that you can buy for if you re looking for good quality and can spend more suggest logitech that why immediately unhooked it and returned it so can go back to buying the logitech ,94,3.0

positive,good product good price,4,4.0
positive,works great no issues with my unit power button feels bit flies saw other reviews complaining about it breaking and could see that happening am careful with mine and don use it frequently can change the color away from rainbow but you can alter the effect slightly didn get this for robust color features so this doesn bother me the keys are bit less diverted and less resistant then what used to frequently hit multiple keys while attempting to push one might bother another with floppy hands like mine but look at it like challenge now that all being said this is hands down great option for tireless gazing there are slightly cheaper keyboard that tout these speck but they seem to be either too cheaply made or have to many reported issues for me to expect quality product on this note this keyboard is rechargeable there are other cheaper bands with similar products but they are mostly battery operated other issues in fact bought keyboard here on amazon that was similar no lights and used batteries it didn work upon arrival this was my second purchase got this for gazing carelessly and use it with additional the receives no issues haven noticed any input delay but sit pretty close to the receiver so distance isn something have stress tested currently this is the keyboard would recommend for tireless gazing under ,231,4.0
positive,first of all the keyboard is far from silent every time hit the space bar there is loud and very audible black secondly just know that you can change the color scheme it just rainbow colored the whole time you can change the brightness and the speed it breathes but that it on the plus side it was economic and comfortable for the minutes used it before plugging it and preparing it for return so there that guess all in all like said returning it this is not what wanted or expected ,92,3.0
positive,perfect christmas gift,3,4.0
neutral,the keyboard must be either front left or right of the keyboard not behind you like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my tireless keyboard on my lap can do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy us extended and hopefully move the signal us stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me ,93,1.0

negative,i just upgrade from budget wired keyboard to this my first tireless keyboard pro types quiet keys are responsive and smooth old budget keyboard was hurting my fingers from extended use feels light and minimalist had long sittings without needing to charge with backlight turned off it uses us charge sons no dedicated buttons for volume etc there are function shortcuts fn key for volume control and calculated this is nitpicking but guess rather have the dedicated buttons for one press instead of hitting the two combined the lighting has distinct high pitched noise that is audible and frustration had to turn it off completely didn buy it for the backlight but it still shame that can ever use it ,120,1.0
neutral,i like the fact can see the keys at night hate the fact that two out of four receiver stopped working still love the two that working ,27,5.0
neutral,i only bought this for the silent keys have newton baby and needed silent click but this keyboard was more loud than my current gazing keyboard if you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere didn even connect it simply started tying and was disappointed stars being generousmaybe the company is comparing their keys to mechanical stroke keyboard if that were the case then every keyboard would be silent compared to those ,73,5.0
negative,not sure why my mice will run charge for several days on single triple battery but this keyboard dies within days of being plugged basically leave it plugged in all the time now which defeats the purpose of tireless keyboard ,40,5.0

positive,the good easy plug and play connection keys are lit up real good and easy to see in the dark keys have nice feel to them and are relatively quiet so far battery charge lasts the whole day of pretty solid gazing the bad user manual is kind so so backlighting turns off kind quickly and sure that can be adjusted but again the user manual is kind so so ,70,5.0
positive, light weight but feels solid you feel the keys but no loud click easy to adjust the brightness and lighting modes wish there was way to adjust the sleep time but other than that love it haven had it long enough to comment on the battery live but their us is little short not major issue for me have spares up to feet long update on the battery life it great obviously it depends on use but it lasts as long if not longer than other rechargeable keyboard have used the us charges it fast when you need it to also have slim blaze tireless mouse and fusion earbuds love can use the same cable to charge the mouse and keyboard the earbuds have much longer cable than most ideal for moving around while you are plugged in to the computer ,141,5.0
neutral,this is almost decent keyboard unfortunately some keys are in very unusual positions for example single apostrophe should be directly left of enter key and backwash should be directly above it this may not be important for casual but this is anathema for covers didn use it long enough to test battery life ,53,1.0
neutral,i like everything about it,5,1.0
negative,i am so angry now the battery life was short had to charge very short time after first use it was out of battery again today so changed it it worked for about minutes after charged then stopped responding tried all us ports of my lawton all working so it the keyboard tried tireless or wired doesn work it just doesn work ,62,5.0

positive,slim customer service is amazing first keyboard got wouldn connect and became did within weeks of use they sent brand new one and it been perfect still use it and it good for genetic tying however after continuous everyday use for hours week ve begun to choose to only use it on days may be less busy tying less quickly the longer use it or the more have to quickly type it will pitch out it adds unnecessary keys know did not hit or will duplicate key stroke hello looks like hello all in all good witness keyboard love that it can be charged with cord battery life is great wakes up quickly and has good response time after sleeping it just can be expected to put up with long intermittent time frames of over wm tying ,137,5.0
neutral,i like the lighted key,5,4.0
neutral,this was gift don know how it is doing,9,4.0
neutral,this was replacement for another expensive illuminated keyboard which got wet findillumination and tireless operation to be very handy the fact that it is water proof or even water resistant is bonus it is not completely silent keyboard but there is very little sound key action is not quite as firm as mechanical keyboard but not squishy battery life remains to be seen but it is casually used daily for at least hours with no issues and only charged it once in week an charge indicator led would be plus so far it has performed very well and met expectations ,100,1.0
neutral,this keyboard has range of about inches and minutes of game time it is not responsive and most likely the chat will have moved on by the time the keyboard decides to start putting what you are tying had it for less than week ,44,5.0

neutral,it does what it supposed to do ,7,1.0
positive,this keyboard is excellent would buy it again use it for gazing have no complaints in that regard have set up where my pp is in another separate room from my bedroom it connected to my to via foot him power tables even through the wall it still manages to get good reception with minimal law occasionally if position really far away in my bedroom on my bed rather than in my gazing chair it will have some brief noticeable law but if turn it off turn it on again it goes back to normal this issue won be problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their pp don want to don like the noise however small that any pp makes the biggest issue have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the rib is on it this high pitched squealing sound it goes away as soon as the rib is turned off this isn problem for me since don care about rib one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery but everytime the keyboard turns on the rib is automatically on and hence the sound is immediately there when turn it on and have to turn it off everytime which is minor inconvenience then again probably have to do turn it off anyway since turn off the lighting to save battery but the sound is noticeable it not as loud as computer fan or anything but since it high pitched you won not notice it ,259,1.0
negative,wouldn take charge and charge light kept turning off just as bad the keyboard lighting wouldn stay on which defeats its whole purpose very disappointed and returning product ,28,5.0

positive,i have the slim tireless keyboard and like it quite bit my work space is rather limited and find it handy to pick up the keyboard and move it out of the way while am multi taking it also handy that the keyboard lights up as my eyes get tired and often forget to put my glasses on so the light up keys are helpful do wish the on off switch was in handed place however however am not game so don know how it might rate in that category otherwise like the keyboard for all other reasons weight size price and overall usage ,104,5.0
positive,smooth feeling keys nice design,5,5.0
positive,so got it for my boyfriend who wanted gazing keyboard but no wire it was on time in the mail looked like it was returned item with all the tape trying to keep the box together but as it came in the original packing it makes sense while it was plugged in we turned it on to see the lights it was very low with other lights interfering but visible at night or in darkness we left it to charge as instructed and it never charged when it was it lasted minutes at most the keyboard connected to the lawton as we saw it under the devices but it wouldn type or send any sort of input in overall wasn good buy on my part but for gift for game boyfriend who have wires he liked it while it lasted ,140,4.0

positive,this keyboard looks and feels really nice it nice and quiet and like the rainbow color display don game much so can really spine on its quality there but imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do although that big enter button might throw you off little bit if you re not used to the layout kept hitting the insert key instead of the backspace from time to time have screen display two are daisy chained monitor using displayport and one is to using him noticed that in its regular position on my desk it seemed to type fine on screen have somewhat delayed buggy input on screen and perhaps due to the distance between the done and the to no response on there moved the done to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side but it still didn accept any input from my keyboard when wasn even feet away from my computer to me that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is large drawback for tireless keyboard especially when paid for it had cheaper logitech that worked just fine for about feet and only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued want to like this because it works great when it wants to but the problems ve had just in the first week aren worth what paid for it almost never return anything but think donna have to with this ,260,5.0

neutral,the keys themselves are fairly quiet but the space bar appears to only be anchor in one spot so it click when you press it calling this keyboard silent is false advertising also have had the problem with using the left curl shift keys in keystroke sequence like when clearing ache or opening an incognito window which regularly need to do for work the right curl shift keystroke works though do like the battery life and the backlight but will be returning this and looking for something different ,88,1.0

positive,purchased it for my son who is game he picked it out after doing the research on amazon he really enjoys the every aspect of the keyboard it is lightweight therefore he has taken it with him abroad ,38,5.0
positive,after months stopped working none of the key functions work the keyboard is fully charged should have read the negative reviews like others have said stopped working right after the return window closed also for what this cost the lighting on it should stay on constant but it doesn you have to hit key for it to come on they charge way too much for this piece of garage amazon needs to give more than month window for returns guess ll stick to best buy for electronics if could have gave it less than one star would have ,98,3.0
negative,i wanted to do stars on this but do have slight issue with the design of the keyboard itself it may be the best keyboard you have owned really ve just broken so dark many it funny not this model yet my main grip is the whole function key is right side only which wouldn be horrible for me if wasn consistently used to handed volume and media control may have just bought the wrong keyboard there are other option this is the one bought and it was bucks and not pleased with it due to this again may work wonders for you non media julie ,106,3.0

neutral,the keyboard is very light and doesn feel too cheap but it never detected on my well computer not sure if it my software windows or the keyboard but it would light up and then go dark when tried tying on it the manual didn explain anything because the keyboard is supposed to automatically be detected and work my other vice mouse and dragon keyboard work just fine returning for refund will stick with my wired for now ,78,5.0
negative,this keyboard stopped working terrible keyboard doesn do all the function it shows to it description avoid this product way overpriced and slim support is also terrible too ,28,5.0
positive,ill start with sons responsive sometimes doesn tell if the battery is low there is no indicator so if your playing intensely and stops all of sudden it will passed off little keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical it will make sound depends how heavy you type you can customize the rib its fixed pro keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off keyboard lights has modes which is cool steady pulse and no lights you can also adjust the light from low to high rechargable and has its own us type cable and has its own bluetooth connection to pp when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to to days without charging it goes on sleep mode if not in use lightweight always put this on my lap since my pp is connected to my to and always play from my bed budget friendly its good keyboard if your not ready for rarer and corsair type of peripheral and looking for budget friendly one then give this keyboard try update am returning the keyboard as it is faulty the and quotation mark got switched its becoming more and more responsive got this days ago and its not doing so well update on battery it lasts days max if used casually am changing my review to star and dont recommend this now better look for something else or really invest to good brand gazing keyboard instead its waste of time and money for just little feature ,262,5.0
positive,i don game so did not find it fair to give it reviews on that factor but this keyboard is great now that am working from home and my days never seem to end this keyboard was just what needed especially for working at night ,45,4.0
positive,just like the head states the windows key no longer functions also don particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than few seconds work on three monitor and need sanctioning windows key to move you guessed it my windows around using the shortest windows shift arrow key figured it was my pp so changed to different pp in the house had the same issue then went back to my wired keyboard no problems another keyboard for the june pile ,86,1.0

neutral,i have dark living room can see the keyboard this one grows in non colors makes it easy to see what you are tying being careless allows me to sit on the couch play games type mails etc without restrictions best one have had yet ,45,5.0
negative,this is good looking keyboard the rainbow colors you see are all you can get so no selection of one color is available although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice not critical issue as said it nice looking keyboard but functional there are couple of issues that are immediately apparent first the enter key as in the picture attached has notch in it that is shared with the key am constantly hitting the and enter resulting in failed password and clusters chat messages so at minimum it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone another issue seems to be battery life instructions indicate hours to charge can accept that what can accept is the life of the battery after in the short time have had this keyboard it has died on my twice within day of getting full charge so sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life so now am keeping it wired with the provided cable because cannot be without keyboard when it dies and plugging it into power source is not enough once the battery is dead it will not power up until it has gotten enough of charge to respond but connected to the pp via us cable makes it online instantly overall poor technical design my only other complaint and it could just be me adapting from lawton keyboard to mechanical desktop keyboard again but tying on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy but while writing this review took moment to look closer the keys on this keyboard are probably good smaller surface area than either lawton typically use this adds to the closeness of the keys and why am constantly off key here and there tying as normally do by feel alone square key up from the base versus the pyramids shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable this is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back ,340,5.0
neutral,the keyboard looks and feels nice to use however have barely uses this keyboard and am encountering connection issues open up web brother go to start tying and nothing happens turn it off and on again wait few seconds then again start tying it doesn type then again few seconds and it registered letters other times it functions properly too unrealiable ,61,1.0

negative,the keyboard itself was lit up it was charged tried multiple us ports and reported my computer also tried on another computer did not want to seem to connect carelessly also in an attempt to get it to work thought that possibly wiring it to my computer using the charging us port it might work just not carelessly which did not then went through amazon teach and am now returning the product think ill be looking for another brand because in still in need of tireless backlit keyboard,88,5.0
positive,it works fine the lights are little dim but that not big deal for me really wanted it because it looked cool it tireless and my old key board was pretty noisy this one looks cool but it just as noisy an english teacher and use the computer during study hall it still makes lot of noise in quiet room ,60,4.0
positive,love this keyboard its exactly what wanted ,7,2.0
neutral,great gazing keyboard not as bright as thought it would be ,11,1.0
positive,beautiful keyboard,2,4.0
negative,my only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights that personal preference know but only turn the lights on occasionally you should also know that the petitioning of the colors is not changeable they are on pulling on off or off no ability to change any of the lights which is fine by me but might bother other people ,76,1.0
positive,needed keyboard that was backlit but did not want just plain white use this for my desktop computer since am now working from home so can speak for games but for my job it been great the colors really pop and you can adjust the brightness or just turn off the color all together very happy with my purchase ,59,3.0
positive,nice tireless keyboard bought to replace logitech tireless b that got banged around for the last couple of years the only minor grip is wish there was bit more margin around the edge often hit key accidentally when picking it up it is light weight wise and the lighted keypad is great for dark rooms ,55,1.0

positive,nice keyboard overall the tactile feedback is pleasant although don like the placement of the key the colourful backlight is cool but some keyboard shortcuts simply do not work curl shift for example doesn work if you use the left curl shift keys that pretty outrageous since that is very common shortest used in many apes on most operating systems it not just my keyboard this is apparently known issue with the keyboard don know how slim can sell keyboard with known defect and without warning about it ,88,4.0

positive, update after or of usage used the keyboard almost everyday for whole year mostly for work rather than gazing and it is still like new then one day had to switch out my lawton at work and forgot to take the us receiver before turning it in unfortunately couldn retrieve it and was beating myself up for it going back to using the lawton keys was highly excruciating so decided to take chance and ask if the us receiver was replaceable their customer service is phenomena the same rep communicated with me throughout the process have you ever played hot potato with customer service then you know how amazing this feels and she always responded pretty quickly to my email there was never law time the only hiccup ran into was at the very beginning when searched for customer service portal through amazon the initial link connected me with the slim technical riding gear rather than slim technologies however they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there they told me the us receiver is replaceable yayyyy but that part was on backorder was more happy to know be able to continue using the keyboard so was willing to wait month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me new one it arrived as promised and can go back to tying comfortably and with lightning speed just got it and have only used it for couple of hours but thoroughly impressed by this keyboard smooth buttons smooth tying comfortable feel and full sized buttons and now have number key pad the presentation was also impressive black little envelope with seemingly personalized note with little flare from the makers when you open the box love it just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play the keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as type hope it lasts forever ,336,5.0

positive,first and foremost have had this keyboard almost year now the first keyboard received was do which anyone who knows much about electronics knows that that is just how it is sometimes contracted their customer support and within week had new keyboard initially this was amazing and saw no issues but as time went on it stopped charging properly believe am on my computer long hours every day as work from home and then game at night if charge it at night with the keyboard set to off it lasts the whole day normally even then sometimes it doesn but overall it does other times even while it is plugged in it shuts off random making gazing hard if slim were reading this would suggest two things add some way to show battery charge on the keyboard and upgrade the battery stability this keyboard after year is acting like the one that was faulty did just year later for those who are reading this would suggest this keyboard unless you use it hours day it simply isn built for that it feels like ,183,1.0

neutral, updated after five months of use the keyboard suddenly died for no reason tried all troubleshooting could and it just doesn turn on turns on for about half second and turns back off guess you get what you pay for doesn last long whatsoever original review had been looking for tireless gazing keyboard that wasn loud and had backlighting it not the perfect keyboard and didn expect it to with that price the two things would change in their second version would be to make the rib bit more versatile or customizable to save little on battery and make the keys feel little more click because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes overall love the weight its disability and sick look knocked it for two things but they are pick at this point ,136,2.0

negative,bought this awhile ago to start setting up my home office didn need it right away so set the box aside pulled it out this weekend to discover that the keys don work correctly multiple keys are stuck together tying or displays to for example keyboard is essentially useless but because didn examine it right away my return window has expired and stuck with june that doesn work lesson learned ,70,5.0
positive,it solid keyboard it feels very light and less substantial that my previous ms tireless comfort keyboard which is still going strong after years it also feels very soft to the touch both the material itself and the key presses think part of this is in the waterproof design what really bought this for is smaller footprints than my previous keyboard it full size keyboard that requires substantially less desktop space it makes difference for my use backlighting for when tying at night and don want the harness of an overhead light or even lamp sometimes the backlighting on this is great if you re fine with the multi color there is an option to turn it off during the day and there is also dimmler which works great what doesn work it weird but when editing text often use curl shift and the arrow keys to highlight large chinks of text at time so far this works on this keyboard but only if using curl shift keys on the left side together or the right side together it doesn fully work when use right curl left shift right arrow keys weird would have much preferred standard sized carriage return enter key for you lounging now to press enter my pink has to travel much farther and it takes noticeable effort the old school reverse shaped enter key is king hope maybe on the version they will correct this if they did it would be worth buying again for that change alone still getting adjusted to the slightly new layout and key response my tying isn as fast yet find with this soft key press business have to press little more aggressive to get the space bar for instance to register it slight but noticeable whether you think that good thing or not is up to you definitely needs palm rest sensitive hands wrists may still prefer the design of curved keyboard swear by curved split keyboard they make difference don use it for gazing so no comment there imagine it responsive enough ,343,5.0

positive,at first this keyboard was everything wanted in tireless keyboard have always been skeptically of tireless keyboard it worked wonders at first but as started to work with it there would be very random connection issues where it would not register my tying this seller was kind enough to send me second keyboard even and the same issue was happening really do think it was an issue with my very many tireless electronics nearby but never found out what the issue was however gave this star rating because of how well it worked when it did and for the customer service don leave very many reviews but this seller really does deserve credit for great customer service experience as well as making great product however unfortunate it did not work for me they were even kind enough to send me gift for the inconvenience and gave me coupon voucher for their other products excellent service ,155,2.0

positive,i ll first mention that if you are buying this you probably don want to spend an arm and leg for gazing keyboard however you definitely get the most for what you pay for ve been using this keyboard for months now and though it isn as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done don really care too much about the light features fading mode breathing mode but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light if the room is well lit you can definitely tell rib is lit but its bit dimmler than expected at night was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key you can see the color very clearly between the keys but not so much for through each key the only improvement suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of tying and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard besides that the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in which is pretty convenient like said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine slim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues ,237,1.0

positive, update still liking the keyboard after months of daily use my only two issues are the button location is terrible am mostly used to it at this point but still accidentally press instead of enter all the time although the battery life is good there is no indicator for low battery this means the keyboard will just unexpectedly stop in the middle of tying when it dead have been using this keyboard daily for the past three weeks use it about his day during the work week and have had to charge it twice since getting it pretty good it is by no means silent keyboard but it is much quieter than my previous keyboard and is not disruption to my office mate husband am reasonably fast type wm and the keyboard is responsive don expect it to blow your mind but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality you are getting for less than ,156,1.0
neutral,the keyboard is definitely quiet but the enter key is in an awkward position if you learned how to type and don hunt and peck you will constantly be hitting the slash key rather than the enter key this gets very frustration when trying to type reports and documents it has nice look and my kiss thought it was cool with the colors but sadly it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs,77,4.0
positive,i ve used this for few months it worked great at first it would die on me after few hours of using so was pretty good about plugging it in when wasn using it now it just sometimes straight up doesn work which gets pretty frustration ll even try to keep the power chord plugged in and turn it off and on again and it still doesn work that is very inconvenient at that point ll just have to turn it off keep it plugged in and take break from whatever doing ,92,3.0

neutral,the things hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews but overlooked them this product is not made in the us even though there is an american flag displayed suggesting it is the supplied cable is only feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard so factor in the price of foot cable that does insert as had to do finally the keyboard lights time out after minute of non use even if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue ,88,2.0

positive,love being able to toss it on the bed when deep into my sobbing and need some space wish the backlight stayed on bit longer but then probably have to charge it more have no problem recommending this keyboard at all ,41,4.0
positive,i pretty happy with this keyboard except for one thing the enter key span two lines and the pipe button is moved down line this small feature really slow down my tying especially in unit environment just can seem to get past that hopefully in time will but twitching between keyboard will likely be an issue other than that they key board lights up nice holds charge is fairly easy to type on wish the keys were like bigger and haven tried swimming with it so can speak to the water proof part can exchange it because already recycle the box ll make it work for now ,107,5.0
negative,this is the second keyboard that ve ordered both had issues very disappointing product ,14,5.0
positive,this is great keyboard for tireless quiet tying really like the use of the colors ,15,5.0
positive,it often stops working at random points even with full charge there will be sudden fits where it won respond for good seconds or it will be super baggy with its input was an idiot forgot it had warranty and bought the first one at least had the courtesy to wait few months to bug out day this thing begged but like the feel of the keyboard its damn satisfying keyboard when it works the buttons are nice to press and the keyboard feels nice in general that why bought another hoping the first was faulty the lights are nice also but sadly can recommend it if keyboard have similar bags hell even tying this out was an ordeal especially when was listing the positive of it will be sending it to repairs but really hope they straighten this problem out ,141,3.0

neutral,the key board looks amazing but some of the keys don work and delete to name few ,17,5.0
neutral,this keyboard looks really good but the description is deceiving as they claim it to be silent or quiet this keyboard is so not close to being quiet one it has really loud keys which want fan of ,38,5.0
negative,someone has missed the point there doesn seem to be way to keep the lights on either carelessly which is the point of purchasing tireless keyboard or wired not power saving move as the shut off timing is the same with the keyboard plugged in the backlighting when it is on is not helpful as it barely shows through the key to highlight the number or letter but shows off the space around the keys so when looking down on the keyboard the eye is drawn to the space around the keys instead of the key itself completely useless strange design choice also interferes with the use of the keyboard there is an extra key next to the enter return which is really annoying instead of hitting enter you are more likely to hit backwash which really makes entering password joy this key is above the enter key on every other keyboard very bad choice on my part from all the tireless backlit keyboard available,165,5.0
neutral,i was looking for low profile keyboard tireless and with large enter key this keyboard fits the bill ,18,1.0
positive,pro the physical design of the keyboard is great feedback on the keys is good has nice matter finish lights are as advertised and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill liquid on it it can drain sons couple times days the keyboard will discontent intermittently on me it will become responsive and discontent then recollect rapidly its not for very long maybe seconds to couple minutes and if at the computer for hours day it will only happen couple times but if in the middle of game it can be quite frustration never have had this issue with other tireless keyboard not sure what the solution is but tried reinstating the driver ,125,2.0
neutral,this pus is advertised as made in us it is actually made in china ,14,3.0
neutral,goes into sleep mode too quickly problem really seems to be good quality product,14,3.0
negative, there are few good things about this keyboard lights number keys tireless rechargeable but the space bar is major deal breakers for me was looking for quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing the space bar is annoying loud even when tying without having to be quiet on conference call it is very annoying my partner down the hall can here me tying good features on this keyboard but really cannot stand the space bar it an instant return for me the worst part is they market this as quiet keyboard it far from quiet ,95,1.0
positive,this is great value am using with my lawton as dont like the keyboard on my lawton love this ,19,5.0
positive,so far it works great hope it stays like that ,10,1.0

neutral,i enjoy the snarkiness of the pp in the package minus the space bar all of the keys are very quiet gave it full charge before use it worked immediately backlighting turns off after its idle for bit simple tap of any key wakes it up dig that the backlighting is multi colored just plain white being that not planning to use it for gazing going to need to get used to the shape of the enter key there is an additional key on the middle row where would naturally hit enter no bigger minus star because the space bar is quite loud ,103,5.0
positive,great gazing keyboard,3,5.0
positive,we love it ,3,5.0

neutral,bluetooth range is no problem rib color is good keys are comfortable to use but two keys stopped working use the due key for gazing so this basically defeats the purpose of buying this keyboard ,35,5.0
negative,so basically was testing the removable keycaps to see if the they actually worked so tried it on the space bar and after took it out couldn get it back in and when got it back in it kept falling out ink if this was my fault or the keyboard fault ,51,5.0
positive, love the colors love that it can be plugged in or tireless love it with my keyboard as well ,19,3.0
positive,works great,2,5.0
positive,what like everything what dislike nothing this review is actually the first thing that tying with this new keyboard the keys feel little space out but ve been stuck with tiny bluetooth keyboard using my phone as my computer which this works fearlessly with the samson galaxy note and with the de set which currently utilizing feel like purchased much more expensive keyboard than what paid for this the packing and items inside are exquisite the glow of the keyboard is bright and fantastic appealing wish this had bluetooth format but maybe the next note will feature conductivity to the devices ,101,3.0
neutral,after less than months it already broken space bar is already dusted son had last keyboard for years and never had an issue very summed ,25,1.0
negative,this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garage it makes gazing fristrating because the keyboard will law you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still laws ,58,3.0
positive,works fine easy to install and use but there is nothing quiet about this keyboard it cracks along just like regular one not advertised as quiet ,26,2.0
neutral,although there is large american flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in china nowhere in the description does it say that paid premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the us and this is just false advertising ,44,3.0
positive,well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the tireless section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juice up so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die have not had to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect ,97,5.0
neutral,highly recommended,2,2.0
positive,pus won hold charge after months of light use can return,11,2.0
positive,this is an excellent keyboard and exactly what was looking for the keys are extremely responsive and like the low profile of the keyboard also the keys are extremely quiet and the different color lighting is cool easy function button combinations controls functions such as turning the color lighting off or adjusting the dimness brightness of the lighting the packing is great and liked the message the company provides in black envelope along with the sticks this product works great with km switch highly recommend ,85,1.0
positive,i had never heard of this brand and was little concerned might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality so glad that not the case this keyboard is all quality they keys feel amazing to type on the lighting comes with few option like adjusting brightness and the whole thing feels sturdy set up was easy of course was reading through the few insects that come in the packing and there even cut description of how the keyboard was shipped to me ,86,5.0

neutral,i surprised how highly rate this keyboard is given that the space bar isn quiet as advertised this isn manufacturing defect it the actual design besides that problem the enter key is whole key further away compared to most keyboard found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be but that place is occupied by the backwash another problem is that in bunt the keyboard shortest for create new older doesn work on this keyboard ,75,1.0
positive,it really great keyboard the only thing don like is that you are unable to change the color other than that it perfect ,23,5.0
positive,you will be needing to charge this keyboard every day ve had keyboard that lasted for months on single charge this is definitely not one of them other than that it great keyboard ,33,5.0
positive,the key doesn work pretty hard to do anything when pretty important letter is not able to be used ,19,1.0
positive,ok product for price point wish battery lasted longer the keys are little awkward have to press harder than normal keyboard but for the price happy love it in the dark wish you could change the rainbow effect to solid color but happy overall use it for work so cannot give full review for gazing but did like the fact no software needed to be installed ,66,3.0
neutral,looked nice while it lasted but it wouldn charge after two months of light use ,15,4.0
positive,i ve bought this keyboard twice now it works great for few months honestly it is my favorite keyboard ve used so when my first one went out after about months bought another unfortunately that one lasted four months and looked out as well it just does this thing where it flicked on for second then turns right off would love to buy another one but don know if can justify buying keyboard that now assume will have to purchase in another months ,83,4.0
positive,its amazing,2,4.0
neutral,lightweight nice looking tireless fair price but it stopped working after less than year really liked this keyboard but dealing with keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and can imagine how to fix it if turn this on it locks up my computer and tries tying numbers and odd ascii characters shame ,55,3.0

positive,have been using it nonstop since got it the look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used has type charge so it works great with your phone charge if you have an andros phone keys do not make noise which is nice connected quickly to my lawton no problems at all wish the company would make tireless mouse to go with this keyboard though ,80,5.0
positive,has great design and excellent features ,6,5.0
positive,i really love this keyboard for the price could not have asked for better one ,15,5.0
negative,everything is perfect but the whole point while got this was because its tireless but tireless is useless if there no reception after feet after year or so can remember it stopped working all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when try to type something in ,50,5.0
neutral,overall it is good keyboard but it runs out of battery really fast my own does not hold on for more than or days would expect to hold the battery for or weeks or even months every week have to connect into the us port to charge when connected to us port still have to connect the bluetooth adapted which makes me use an extra us port why not just use the us came to also communicate with the pp why do have to use both while charging the keyboard ,90,5.0
negative,the us receiver got stuck in my lawton us port ended up having to get it out with piers fortunately this didn cause any damage to the us port very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works at all and it almost damaged my lawton the us receiver came out in pieces at time and not sure if it even function properly to begin with it most definitely doesn function now ,74,1.0

positive,awesome,1,4.0
negative,the keyboard did not function correctly the moment opened plugged it some of the keys just don work received broken keyboard and it pain to return due to could ,29,1.0
negative,a solid keyboard for the price the battery life is not very good and if you use your computer lot it sort of defeats the purpose of it being tireless the keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboard the backlighting provides nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on single charge however the light level makes the keys very visible in dark or dimly lit room if the ribs are important to you consider keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off on and glow with option to tongue light level and glow frequency ,106,3.0
positive,overall great keyboard and rechargeable too the computer doesn give you any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid use similarly the battery life isn cellar but that to be expected of light up keyboard overall good value at its price point ,50,5.0
neutral,i like the raised keys not using for gazing but for work what dislike is that it doesn have setting for backlight to stay on which is what wanted ,29,5.0
positive,i don use this for gazing and haven used the sleep mode so can really rate it like the way it lights up and it good keyboard only issue is lost the charging cable and can seem to find replacement not even on their webster do recommend this though ,49,5.0
neutral,it fairly bright but you re stuck with the one rainbow color pattern and some of the colors are not as bright as others making tying in the dark harder than it should be the keys are raised up and leveled like keyboard from years ago so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboard this makes tying and accuracy little slower some of the keys are placed little weird too the key to the left of the enter key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark this one has the backwash and vertical line as was used to my last keyboard kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be ll likely be replacing this soon ,116,3.0
positive,fast shipped love it the keyboard works great ,8,1.0

positive,outstanding product and customer service thanks ,6,3.0
neutral,this is an awesome keyboard but what trigger my purchase was that thought it was water proof not sure how got that idea think some reviews had read were making mistake of saying water proof and not water resistant had also read reviews on another site that mentioned silicon sealed internal and the keyboard has quite few holes in it they are very well engineered for liquid to run onto and through the keyboard drying it very quickly have inquisitive pet birds that knock stuff over all the time onto my keyboard and are also fascinate with stopping around on the keys seems to be weird fascination with most larger birds have seen so the idea of keyboard could just wash in the sink was awesome except that it isn have ran into few other people that have made the same assumption and instant destruction of an awesome keyboard as myself wouldn even really call it water resistant the board the battery wires and well everything is simply placed inside with no covering or anything while the drainage holes do help mitigate spill damage the internal components seem very ill quite for moisture of any type my keyboard died quite instantly upon wiping it down with damp rag bit on the wet side though rung out quite bit so be careful this was selling point that somehow got very confusing which failed upon light testing of the water resistance ,239,1.0

negative,i was excited to try tireless keyboard and really thought would like this battery life would last about full day and half but it charged fast the lights made it easy to type at night which was also bonus tying with it was sort of annoying noisy but could have forgiven that if the product was actually decent after few weeks the tying just got completely baggy and every few keystrokes missed it became impossible to type on plugging it in with the charge wire didn fix the problem so switched back to my old wired keyboard waste of money for how fast this broke down ,106,5.0

positive,this is an amazing keyboard silent keystrokes backlit that isn blinding or distracting super high quality and the best part of all it rechargeable ,24,5.0
positive,so far have been satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it to others the one issue is the special cord to charge the keyboard and the ability to match the lighting to my lawton do understand the limits on the battery life that prevent the keyboard from staying active all the time but would like to be able to dim the keyboard when inactive but with the light still bright enough or at least marker key to engage the lights to make it easier to see in the dark it may be little it pick but the purpose of the lights is to allow me to see and enjoy the back lights while playing and not have to stop and turn on light just to re orient my self to the keys while trying to immense myself in game ,140,5.0

negative,i was really interested in this because it markets itself as quiet and let me tell you if never needed to use the space bar it would be very very quiet however as most modern languages call for spaces between words this keyboard is incredibly loud if you so much as look at the space bar it cracks it probably the only thing you can hear from my desk as every other key is so silent the space bar ruins the rest of the key board no conductivity issues the time out is fine battery is fine keys work great but gash dark is it loud don know if it going to stop bothering me at some point trying to give it time but may have to just scrap this keyboard and try different brand say spend your money elsewhere as this is beyond annoying ,145,1.0
positive,i purchased this keyboard for use with my gazing machine using it upon my lap in chair with arm rests it doesn fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it wish the keys were more generally located for my back sake great backlight which dealuminates after use keys are bit clung an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine which use hours every day ,105,5.0

negative,some standard hotels don work with the left shift button disappointed but want to like this keyboard the company refused me then ordered another one cause it neat keyboard and hoped the problem was luke hope same problem on the second one specifically curl left shift any of the following u m do not work on this keyboard if you normally use curl right shift any key suppose you won notice problem but for me first noticed it trying to select inverse in photoshop curl shift and found the other problems using keyboard shouting tool aside from that problem like this keyboard but it really tout anti shouting stuff so did not expect this kind of problem it might not seem like big deal but it easier for me to just use different keyboard than re learn decades old muscle memory and who knows what other key combinations are faulty ,150,5.0
positive,that is perfect thank you ,5,5.0
negative,i purchased this item because of the backlighting planned to use it in our living room at night to interact with our to the backlighting is great like the feel of the keyboard but yesterday connected it to my desktop was having problems when would hit the return key with my left pink after comparing the slim with the worn out logitech am replacing found that there is an extra key between the quotation mark key and the enter key the backwash key has been moved down row if were hunt and peck types suppose this would be fine but learned to touch type years ago use my touch tying skill many times day why would want to teach myself how to find the enter key all over again to press key thinking that am using the enter key and then finding that have backwash or that the item failed to load is maddening dislike giving low score to such good looking keyboard but if buyers have the same concern as do they need to know what they are buying would also prefer larger delete key ,186,5.0
neutral,this was great buy but reason gave it stars is it doesn have very long range to operate in you can only go about feet before you lose connection ,29,5.0

positive,the keyboard looks and works great ,6,4.0
negative,this keyboard is deceptive it really pretty and feels good to use but in about months of use it started having response issues use it for gazing and it would random stop responding or law for few seconds to minutes before recovering it does this regardless of charge status and even when plugged in used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn the bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it think either the keys lose responsivity or the bluetooth signal is losing connection ,90,5.0
positive,i love the back lighting rechargeable battery and light personally only sit at desk when playing games mostly like tireless so don have to sit at flat surface for the keyboard use like to sit back from my computer on inch monitor to for email you tube video and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing webster your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and tying with the right the keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have spot to use thumb to hold without touching key little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the est key an another model perhaps flared out going to the top ,138,5.0

positive,it not mine but my son got it for christmas and he really likes it over the box controller ,19,5.0
positive,i have been using this keyboard for about or days now and so far it works really well for it intended purpose love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when am tying that being said there are few things that knocked this keyboard down to only stars the first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent this is not the case in fact have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the enter key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys for me this hasn been huge deal but can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having quiet keyboard the second thing is that the led lights are not as bright as would have wanted in the dark they stand out perfectly and look amazing however in daytime or brighter lighting the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard ,174,4.0
positive,it fast and comfortable to use,6,5.0
positive,battery life is great great beginner keyboard,7,5.0
positive,nice keyboard at this price just make sure your computer is bluetooth compatible for tireless operation ,16,5.0
positive,easy to use great to go tireless ,7,2.0
positive,i have been using this keyboard for almost and half months and at first issues with finding the on off switch for turning on tireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for tireless and charging after found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient would recommend this to anyone looking for good tireless keyboard with long battery life ,66,5.0
negative, big design problems the lights don stay on probably to conserve the battery this means if you are not using the keyboard for few seconds say you are just using the mouse or just reading the screen the keys go dark then you can see whatever key you need to hit first when you are ready the enter key is one key farther to the right than standard keyboard as life long touch types now am tying when mean to hit enter so not only did not gain the ability to see the keys in the dark but lost the expected location of the enter key just couple of points of clarification you cannot change the colors you can just adjust the brightness of the backlighting and you can put it on some weird breath setting where it slowly goes brighter and darker this does not take batteries like most tireless keyboard it actually requires wire to charge the built in battery which is killed as taking hours to charge for hours of usage might as well leave it connected so much for tireless ,184,1.0
positive,grandson loves it it is awesome love the colors not to bright ,12,5.0
positive,works great great value for the money ,7,4.0
positive,i got this as gift for my husband for christmas and couldn be happier for this has good set of lights and it comes with built in battery that charges via us my husband loves it and at it was steal and customer for life now the only minor thing about this is that it sleeps little too fast but any key waking it up makes that almost null ,69,1.0
neutral,this was purchased for pp that occasionally gets used for gazing but nothing intensive on the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room something have struggled to find in other purchased keyboard second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen have mid high corsair that cannot do that at times the price tag and battery life is way longer than the more expensive corsair my only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the enter return key all of my other keyboard without exception have horizontal return key this one has moved the key with the forward slash mark to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal for touch key types this creates problem since the pink finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboard for games this is an acceptable expensive keyboard and well worth the money for touch types you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustration this is an update from original initial review device did not last year and stopped working altogether as did the expensive corsair have gone back to good wired keyboard ,248,4.0

negative,less than months after receiving my keyboard it stopped working the on off switch on the back of the keyboard seems to have something to do with the problem the keyboard stopped working couple of weeks after the return window closed so was referred to slim directly long story short slim never resolved the issue despite the fact that this product has warranty sent about email before giving up would definitely not recommend the product when purchased the keyboard was excited about the features described but if the product doesn function then those features are useless note didn have any problems with the amazon seller ,105,2.0

positive,love it use it for work in darker room ,9,2.0
positive,update reorganized the living room and it seems that the tireless signal improved lot corners seem problematical for the done with good direct line of sight it works well really like the look and the fact that the enter key is large iso layout the key between and left shift is missing the not sure whether it should be there anyway packing is nice and adds emotional value the us charging cable is little too short the bad news is if it is not close enough to the done it fails lot after it goes to sleep it sometimes wakes up responsive you get key double presses and lost keystrokes random copying passing and cutting can be chose because you don know if the keyboard sent the curl or curl appropriately if you figure out how to keep steady link between the keyboard and transmitted you re all good wish there was way to know how much battery is left if you re ok spending more on keyboard go for the pro stuff if you re on budget it good pick dear slim guns like you try improving conductivity for solid reliable tireless performance and showing battery usage,198,5.0

neutral,on time delivery and nice quality,6,5.0
neutral,the keyboard itself as keyboard works fine however there are few things that need improvement the backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay like up even when the backlight fades out need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off user that likes the back light to stay on not fan of the fading in out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols the enter key is too far to the right for comfortable tying selection meaning that the enter key should be where the key is normal keyboard have the enter key closer in this position so when tying we easily select the right key but you have the key where the enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key the keyboard isn that quiet hitting the keys when tying softly the keys still make lot of noise ,177,4.0
positive,it an ok product for the most part there are few things that noticed that lead me to give this product only stars the sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable it turns off the led lights after about seconds and if you re trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard there should be an ability to leave it on the brightness on the led lights is not very good in completely dark room it may be possible but in room with partial illumination like lamp or even the light from your to monitor screen the keys get little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen the stroma colors make such dimly lit product that much harder to see and you can adjust this it would be better if you could make it just green white or blue lights but the stroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim to top it off the less are so far under the keys that you get more of halo effect around the undermine of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves the only pro have about this product are the price cheap for what it is the quiet no click of the keys perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep us charge compatible aside from the things mentioned at the top of this post there are some extra that could have made this product better dedicated buttons for ff rev play pause vol up down mute having to constantly press function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charge is plugged in had mouse that did this and it was great feature and when the battery could no longer hold charge just replaced it the the done is awesome but also having bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don have us ports but keep the done not happy with mine will return it and spend little more on better solution for me ,382,5.0
neutral,the keyboard is good it does not have any noise the light is cool but sometimes the keyboard would repeat press one key ,23,5.0

positive,i got this for gazing on my box one plugged in the us adapted and that it it works great great price for great product and would purchase again great battery life also,33,5.0
positive,this keyboard is extremely comfortable to type on and the backlight makes it possible to type with the lights off ,20,1.0
positive,i needed new keyboard for my is pro and this is the best one ve had so far it not as compact as the mind keyboard ve been using but this one works very well so far ,37,5.0
positive,great keyboard for everyday use led nice write only wish it would stay on longer or on all the time otherwise great keyboard,23,4.0
positive,love the lights and it is quite love the charge time and how long it stays charged great keyboard all around easy to use and set up ,27,4.0
negative,this keyboard is thoroughly average you press keys and the computer reacts there are no stitches the backlight turns on so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised unless it goes to sleep there is nothing to set this keyboard apart in fact it is lacking in some ways for example there is no way to determine how much matter power you have left which is excusable for tireless gazing input device there is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of gazing session they did not even need to write software to display this information windows can display it if the device simply provides it am also not fan of the key layout they got creative with the placement of the backwash key instead of being in its normal position above the enter key they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backwash in between that and enter enter has been stretched up to backspace the end result is that if you try to type backwash or pipe characters say when entering paths or escape characters or coming you wind up hitting the enter key instead possibly times since you re tying without looking on instinct don know how many times have tried to type in path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the os by pressing enter instead of backwash very frustration the quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying but not quite as bad if you are developer this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone particularly if you then go to work and use keyboard with standard layout maybe others are different but the absolute last thing want in keyboard is less than standard key layout it renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience ,305,3.0
neutral,the keys are very buggy in response takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit key so it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again it is pretty and the company sends you cut email after you buy it but just garage product overall have had to buy new keyboard just days after purchasing this one as it id border line unable,85,5.0
neutral,it looks good and like the lighted keys when need to use my computer at night for short time no longer have to turn on the light ,27,1.0
positive,i use this keyboard for my is as play mostly at night and needed quieter way to play online with people this does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controller my only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others but overall it hasn been significant issue and serves its purpose ,74,5.0
positive,solid keyboard lighting is bit dim and the timeout is definitely too short as it goes dark too quickly other than those issues it works perfectly and the battery life has been more than adequate ,35,2.0
positive,the keys are very quiet and the led add nice touch to the office however for tying occasionally do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers the downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at glance overall happy with my purchase ,62,4.0

neutral,works great adjustable lighting stays charged for long time no chord in the way smooth keys light weight only small complaints when it is in sleep mode whatever key you hit to wake it actually works therefore you have possibly type wrong key when using password to open something also you can pick one solid color again nothing major would buy another one or recommend it ,66,4.0
positive,the back lights are not as bright as wanted them to be work in the dark really wanted to see it glow while was working the keyboard it self is perfect size for me the charging light never comes on but that is ok over all would buy another one for my home location,54,1.0

positive,as far as gazing is concerned not using it for that using it because have diabetic retinopathy and it helps with seeing the keys the brightness is perfect the battery life have not ran into problem have used it when my computer is locked and several days have gone by without charging it again so to me that great ,59,5.0
positive,updated used to be stars now find the lighted keyboard distracting but when turn the light off can see the characters on the keys had to buy sticks for the keys so could use the keyboard without the light on this hopefully will help my second issue which is having to charge the thing when it starts misbehaving tireless ought to mean no need for wires would prefer batteries easier to replace batteries every couple of months than to charge every week otherwise the keyboard is fine update the mouse in this comb became baggy after about month taking second or two to respond when used it that law has increased to the point that today am still waiting for my curses to respond an hour after footing up new battery made no difference useless ordering different brand today ,139,5.0

positive,everything is great except the enter key ,7,5.0
neutral,letters needs to be bolder not bright enough,8,5.0
neutral,it would be better if you had setting that made the lights stay on all the time,17,5.0
positive,when turned it on and the back lights appeared in beautiful rainbow pattern was blown away it is such nice keyboard am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt what love best about the product is everything really the keys are soft and comfortable with the exception of the space key love how quiet these keys are can type discreet without being too loud love that the lighting is adjustable both in pattern and brightness the breathing mode is very neat feature and like that can adjust the speed of it it has calming effect but also like that can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if don want them on the tireless feature is neat because can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don have to worry about plugging it in like the little legs on the bottom so can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if want it to be more or less economic the battery display is great feature because can tell when need to plug it in before it loses power also like that the done that plugs into the computer has little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use on the instructions pamphlet at the very end it says thinks for reading it should say thanks for reading it obvious that great care was taken to create high quality product so it disappointing to see such careless error one other thing don care for is how loud the space bar is all the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make sound but when tap the space bar it makes loud plastic sound that seems to resolute throughout the room for how often it gets used was hoping it would be bit quieter other than those two things wouldn change anything this product is very easy to use the instructions were incredibly helpful and well written it nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages it gives the impression that this is worldwide company and because of that very successful it gives the company lot of credibility the instructions were easy to read and follow like that the function keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard absolutely love this keyboard and would recommend it to all of my friends whether you have lawton or desktop computer this keyboard is not only great to look at it works very well there is an incredible value for the money here have several slim products in my office and love each one am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again ,470,5.0
neutral,i bought this specifically because it said it was quiet keyboard not even close it is no more quiet than normal keyboard false advertising and false description of the product have quiet he keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description this one went back in the box and ordered another he tireless elite keyboard wish had just ordered another he in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard ,84,4.0
positive,this keyboard is satisfying purchase it checks all the right boxes and is great for gazing work and everything in between ,21,5.0
negative,i have to change my review from star to star had surgery couple weeks ago so my keyboard sat unused for weeks and getting back to it it only works about half the time it either won type anything at all or it types the wrong thing nothing was spilled on it it is dust free damaged etc now realize the lighting up underneath is hampering problem instead of good thing because if all it did was light up under the keys that would be fine but without the keys having painted on white letters they re virtually impossible to see and that pain in the ass wanted to return the keyboard for refund so could get different one but apparently passed that window while was recovering from surgery also have asked questions of the seller but they have yet to be answered so my original star review has now dropped to star and if this continues over the next week ll leave worse review and drop it to star for customer service alone paid for product and expect it to work and if it not going to work expect to be able to get my money back so can find product that does work am an author and game and this has really missed up both aspects ,218,4.0
neutral,product is as described pleased with my purchase ,8,5.0
positive,letters are small and faint even with the back lighting perhaps there is way to increase the brightness,18,5.0
positive,i like to keep office lights turned down depending on task at hand and appreciate the illuminated keys this is just for my personal office use would actually prefer the option to use battery power but charging by us now and then is fine personally was looking for keyboard with larger letters as my eyesight has gotten worse but any option saw was wired not offered as tireless would also have preferred all one color but for my personal use this is rather pretty ,84,5.0
neutral,if you type too fast certain keys will not register,10,1.0
positive,really great keyboard game and have had zero issues it has quick response time can tell the difference between this and my wired razor black widow keyboard my only feedback for the company would be to provide some sort of indication software or hardware based of how much battery life there is ,52,2.0
positive,i am not game but love the keyboard that light up and change color finally needed new keyboard for work so ordered this one since it was such great price and am not fancy keyboard person curved piece etc and love this keyboard am probably going to buy second one for home this is perfect for me super happy with my purchase and super fast shipping stars plus ,68,5.0

positive,really nice keyboard its far quiet than mechanical keyboard which is what want the finger resist is slightly higher but its fine battery lasts me about week on full brightness there is not many sons so am nick picking but every time you turn off the keyboard it forgets your settings and the actual placing of the off button is unusual so just always leave it on now its really just to stop the cat walking on it anyway highly recommend it especially if your computer doesn have bluetooth,89,5.0

positive,really cool keyboard the rainbow lights look awesome like that they turn off on automatically while in use to avoid draining battery faster can speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it just for personal use and not heavy gazing or regular work use the charging cable is short for my liking prefer to plug it into an adapted and not the computer for efficient charging the feel of the keys is nice they press easily but not too easily tying is quiet the keyboard is very lightweight which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use it also fairly compact for full keyboard so it nice it doesn take up much space ,140,5.0

positive,to me personally this item looks so however bought it for friend and she says it works perfectly and makes her desk area look alive ,25,5.0
neutral,because the keylighting was not distinctive enough and because the time out was too fast for our preference it did not meet our needs ,24,5.0

neutral,there placement of backwash next to the enter key throws me off and keep hitting that key ,17,1.0
positive,rib is good with on off and breathing very small and light keys are close together and not too loud main thing is it doesn hold charge for long if you game lot this keyboard only lasts not even days no warning just shuts off at the perfect time ,49,5.0

neutral,the product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly would spend money elsewhere,32,5.0
positive,i ordered this after my very old he tireless keyboard decided to tap out on me with few of the keys just no longer working at all since my family member didn want to spend the on can of compressed air to fix it so tried few ways to see if it could be fixed trying few other tips on my own as it was bit grim dirty but unfortunately for whatever reason the keys still wouldn work so figured why not purchase brand new one after searching on amazon my eyes were immediately drawn to this one to be honest so far am really liking this keyboard especially the colored lighting when it hits nighttime talk about really fifty idea so far love it the one downside have with this keyboard though is the fact that it has to be charged using charge to connection my tireless pp when needed unfortunately need to discontent my separate tireless mouseconnector in order to charge up the battery for the keyboard as my pp only has us ports on the left side from what can tell as don know if it might have few more us ports in the very back which is bit of possible small letdown but am sure ll get used to it overcome with that said it arrived in timely quick manner am super excited to begin using it donna hope that will last as long as it does ,241,5.0

neutral,very efficient,2,5.0
negative,the fact that you can keep the lights always on totally defeats the purpose of buying this product for gazing and night time using the lights turn off too fast if you are not constantly tying something even at their longest settings and you can select just one of the five colors of the less so you are stuck with the rainbow lights also it not that very quiet compared to an old mechanical keyboard have it only about quieter hate the fact that thought was buying an american product because of the american flag on their main advertising image on it front page but it made in china ,109,5.0

neutral,changed the batteries out twice the keyboard must be plugged in to work once you plug it from the wall it dies ,22,1.0
negative,garage colors on keyboard go in and out and if you don touch keyboard for seconds it goes completely black waste of money can see the keys when am gazing at night terrible one star for liability ,37,5.0
positive,i was desperately in need of new keyboard and thought might as well upgrade to tireless board and mouse comb for the price and shipping speed was very excited for this product however it would not connect for longer than just few keystrokes then it would be responsive until left it alone for few minutes then could type another characters before starting the process over again promptly returned it and really like my new set granted had to wait little longer will say this keyboard had great feel and excellent footprints for smaller desk it seemed fairly easy to be able to carry around with lawton although not recommended ,109,3.0
neutral,the bluetooth receiver works well can put it in the back of my computer and not have an issue with connection much quieter than my previous click black old keyboard but it not silent it gets louder the more quickly you type as well but if you take your time it can be decently quiet no extra buttons need to press fn to use the secondary key commands but works well for my purposes just leave the lights on unless guests come over ll ,84,4.0
positive,i bought this to replace logitech tireless keyboard used to control my hope from the couch about feet away the logitech was not lighted and the signal was not very good from that distance this slim keyboard has completely reliable tireless connection and hasn missed keystroke yet and love being able to see the lighted keys at night the battery is pretty decent as well lasting around days before need to charge it again with heavy use it comes with us charge cable that you just plug into any us charge or pp us port to charge the built in battery the only slight negative is the layout is iso vs anti and takes bit to get used to overall highly recommend this keyboard ,124,2.0

positive,the slim keyboard had good reviews so thought give it shot glad did ve been looking for deal on backlit keyboard but everything found was plus for gazing board really like this for the smaller frame yet having key included the multicolor backlighting is nice although the colors are fixed and only allow adjustment for pulse on or off and dining don use keyboard for gazing much so really can comment on that the bottom line is if you are looking for an expensive keyboard that looks good has backlighting decent battery life and has smaller footprints for full size board then this is it ,105,3.0
positive,i love the look of this and the quality is great ,11,5.0
positive,i bought the keyboard for my boyfriend it awesome great to use in the dark although when the lights are pulsating the keyboard does make ringing sound other than that it was really easy for him to adjust from his old keyboard to this one and we ve charged it once for like minutes and it been working for days of use so the battery life is great definitely nice product,71,5.0
neutral,not enough lighting modes effects,5,5.0
positive,i originally ordered this keyboard just over years ago and was and still am very happy with the product the product is lightweight the keys feel nice and they are pretty quiet like that it has the separate number pad but the whole keyboard is not too large or bulky the rechargeable battery lasted longer than expected so was able to take advantage of the tireless feature when the battery does die you can still use the keyboard while it is plugged in and charging and the battery light on the top right corner turns off when its charged the rainbow colour lights behind the keys are nice touch too am not game though so have no comment on its features for that purpose just recently the battery started to die more frequently and had to plug it in more often which was not the end of the world for me as most keyboard require cords anyway however the battery eventually started to expand and the keyboard warped and became unable went back to my amazon order and checked to see if there was warranty and there was years reached out to customer service via email with pictures of the keyboard and my original voice they responded within the same day and offered me replacement have the replacement now and still love it the company has provided exceptional customer service they were very responsive and they stand behind their product they even checked in with me to make sure that received the replacement and that it was working as expected ,260,4.0
neutral,i professional who writes lot and thought on giving this low budget keyboard try it is not suitable for heavy writing work as it becomes really heavy on the hands after few thousand words it is however well designed keyboard that can be used for simple daily computing ,48,5.0
positive,i use this keyboard for gazing great product and good customer service as well ,14,5.0
negative,very disappointed with this keyboard do lot of office work and the curl shift doesn work on the left side of the keyboard did little research and it appears this is common issue you have to use curl shift on the right side which is so awkward will be returning this keyboard as am not happy with it on side note it is very quiet when type but the spacebar is much louder than the other keys ,77,5.0
positive,considering it keyboard and the title indicates long lasting rechargeable battery you expect the charge to last little longer the fancy glow lights obviously drain it faster than you expect it gives you no warning when the charge is low just quits and you have to plug it in otherwise it is keyboard the lights are cool bought this for the careless factor after it charged but it the star feeling not bad not great it fine ,77,1.0
neutral,it isn waterproof it just false sense of security went awhile without spelling anything on it and just last week spilled water on it turned it off right away kept it off till it dried up and it completely done bought water proof keyboard cut it supposed to be water proof ,51,1.0
negative,i dont usually give feedback but this one has to be my worst purchase in long time despite of all the positive reviews got my keyboard in november many times have got letters being type double few days ago the keyboard just stopped working no more lights no more signal and no more life that keyboard went straight to the trash can ,62,1.0
positive,awesome keyboard the lights are amazing and the keys feel great when tying ,13,1.0
negative,i loved this keyboard for the months it worked then all of sudden the keys either lagged or didn register the click at all then came the conductivity issues it would not work at all even though the us was plugged in and it was charged would have to troubleshoot for an hour and only sometimes it would work again other times just gave up now after having it for months decided to see if could get it to work again after storing it for about month it does not even register that it is charging so she dead dead very upset with this product ,105,2.0
neutral,my lawton has keys that don work so tried to rest it and sign back in the keys still didn work so ordered this key board and got it day later charged it by port cord which didn know was supplied plugged the us in and didn need to install anything it just worked ,54,5.0
positive,this is very nice keyboard and of good quality there was no issue getting my pp to recognize it once plugged in the us adapted one annoying thing about the keyboard is that the background light turns off after about seconds get that this is probably to preserve battery life but in dark environment such at nighttime or for gazing it hard to find the characters on the keyboard when the background light is turned off it would have been nice if there was an option to leave the background lights on while the computer is on or have them turn off after seconds of inactivity would have given this keyboard much higher rating if it weren for this ,119,1.0
neutral,after months of use keys p n have died did not spill any water onto it and was used somewhat frequently for programming guess that is expected due to the cheap price point but was hoping it lasted at least bit longer ,42,5.0
positive,got it for family member they have been very happy with the keyboard battery life could last longer but is still good for night of gazing keyboard works while charging if you need to play for the full day and the on off switch really helps save power when you take break one problem to not is that keyboard remains on while changing even if you switch it off this is minor problem but could be larger issues for others ,80,1.0
positive,they were very responsive and were able to help me as needed thanks ,13,5.0

positive,great price onlycomplaint is cord gets tangled lot,8,5.0
neutral,i was enjoying these headphones although they had some odd features like the dual cable that is excessively long the sound quality was pretty great for the price while it lasted but they made odd cracks and pips from time to time maybe from whatever issue caused them to stop working either way am not impressed and even if were to get another pair of headphones from this brand would not try anymore at this price point ,77,1.0
negative,microphone is bad build quality is horrible feels very cheap like you could purchase at below ,16,5.0

neutral,after two months had lost my mid and now the wire has become disconnected from the heads did say just two months couldn believe it because they had decent reviews ,30,5.0
neutral,the sound quality both playback and recording is fine however find the earmuff portion of the heads to be bit too small as it does not fit around my entire ear and don have particularly large ears again this probably wouldn be huge issue for most people but if you have earrings it might be bit uncomfortable ,57,1.0
neutral,had an issue they sent me the wrong color first time as well as faulty heads that had audit issues they promptly handled the issue and have to say for the price point it good heads,36,1.0
negative,this product has been advertised as having led capability and it does but the lights are not bright enough that was the whole entire purpose of what had purchased this set for disappointing and considering beginning return plus the led lights engineered into this unity are barely colored purple and that is what classify as entirely weak knee lackadaisical engineering prowess disappointing ,62,1.0
positive,this is perfect for kiss just getting into gazing that aren yet mature enough to be gentle on very expensive gazing heads would purchase again ,25,2.0
neutral,broke so fast made out of plastic if you dropped it on your bed it could ve broke it antique at this point do not buy this please at all costs ,31,1.0
neutral,the cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so can only hear in one ear and have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it the mid cancers most noise but the heads does not cancel any noise and since have fan on can hear it with my heads on and it gets annoying while trying to game ,74,3.0

neutral,it is very good in sound quality noise cancellation,9,2.0
neutral,this does not work with my is will be returning ,10,5.0
negative,this product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect while it states that it is compatible with the intend switch and box one systems the microphone is not compatible with either unless you pay and extra for an adapted to make the microphone work the worst thing though is the return window you have like weeks to return it then you are stuck with it spent two weeks trying to get it to work and firing out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapted now am stuck with these useless things very very disappointing it is definitely worth it to pay more money for better product that is actually compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with ,125,1.0
positive,so the sound quality is pretty great but the mid seems to be picking up voices from the games play have to lower the dialogue volume if that is an option if not have to turn down the whole game volume to get the mid to not pick it up through the headphones perhaps if the mid was further away from the headphones but because it is so short it seems to pick up voices from games or video really easily edit so the mute tongue on the cord does not prevent this audit picked from the mid it completely stops my voice and sounds from my environment but it somehow is still picking up voices from games or video even when the mute tongue is on ,127,1.0
neutral,i turn it up to max and it just not loud enough for me do however like the flowing pink on the sides ,23,1.0
neutral,these were really nice in the beginning don use my heads often for personal reasons somehow this magically has short in it the sound was never that great and always static like anyway ,33,2.0

neutral,mid stopped working after use bought it in advance for birthday and can return it fun ,16,1.0
negative,overall underwhelming heads given it cheap price sure it could meet your needs don like that the ear puffs don turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear can imagine wearing these for long periods of time the chord connection is obnoxious long unless this is something you re looking for mid settings mute is all basic controls which is expected with lower price point mid overall not practical for long term use in my opinion will be returning ,79,5.0
neutral,my son said they worked well for couple of hours then they stopped working no sound couldn talk ,18,1.0
neutral, ,0,3.0
positive,my little brother got these for his birthday and absolutely loves them he takes em with him everywhere ll haven actually played with em but the one time had them on they seemed pretty comfortable as for noise concealing the boy can hear damn thing when he playing his games so be willing to wager they do good job at that ,61,1.0

positive,the noise cancellation is great had these headphones for little over year before my dog thought it be cut to chew through the extra thick braiding on the cord would recommend trying these if you re on budget ,38,5.0
neutral,the controller needs to be close to the is because of the short length of the cable can even adjust the length of it so have to play extremely close to the to and is and it uncomfortable to hold ,40,5.0
neutral,these headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks most games of any level or even someone who needs to use it for room conferences needs decent quality mid this is not that the positive reviews must only be focused on the sound and the look just got these couple hours ago and will be returning s,59,1.0
positive,these lasted just long enough for the return window to close the sound quality and everything about them were actually great while it lasted the first thing to go was the mid guessing it was fine at first then my teammates started to say hey your mid is garage it sounds terrible mute your mid then after the mid started going the end of the plug is now slipping out of the jack all the time and the sound from the speakers almost is starting to sound clipping if these lasted year or so would say great buy but they didn they lasted like month or less ,107,4.0

neutral,in this price range these headphones are top notch replaced my former pair same brand with these and have no complaints ,21,1.0
positive,what liked about the headphones is they are good for my games if there is bass or low tones the headphones feel like they shake bit however the headphones are only ok when concealing noise can still hear some vehicles drive by outside it is my own fault for not reading the description carefully but what do not like about the headphones is that they need us attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights the us that attached to it as cord is really short but over all like them,94,1.0

negative,bad quality microphone does not work if you touch the cord at all the headphones don work do not recommend ,20,3.0
positive,the audit quality and fit are pretty nice however key feature needed was mid built into the heads the gain on the mid is maybe making it completely inaudible loud blowing into the mid brings it up to an audible level on playback but far from normal interaction when conversing will continue to use my very old logitech mid which is far superior in audit capture ,66,1.0

neutral,it didn work for my box series put in the adapted and still didn work ,15,5.0
positive,these work great good shutting out noise they sound great you can tell the surround sound good bass only down side to me is they seem to be made for lawton cause the the us cord for the lights is super short for controller use you could put one of those power bars on it button it just hangs there other then that great buy,65,5.0
neutral,it works really well,4,5.0
positive,love the color and the sound and ability to talk with ease as game ,14,1.0
positive,its great product,3,5.0
neutral,the headphones are made for children heads the earpieces don cover an adult ears the plastic and shape of the heads itself feels cheap and readable the microphone quality is atrocious and makes anyone speaking through it sound like the stereotypical kid screaming into mid on fortunate ,47,4.0
neutral,does not work with the is and they are not well made the ear ad came off almost right away and they don even work well with the computer in order to have sound you need mm jack which the is does not have the us seems to be power source for the brilliant blue lights don recommend these at all the lights are nice but not worth it since they don do what they should ,76,5.0
negative,i purchased this as an admittedly cheap heads just have something to use until could afford better one and within weeks of owning it the heads stopped working would not be detected at all by any of my pus had amazon replace it with another one and that nd one failed the exact same way less than hours later unreal would advise anyone looking for heads to look elsewhere terrible cheap awful product ,73,1.0

positive,ordered this for my year old son the second he opened it he could tell it was june but he tried to give it fair shot both my boys are really big into gazing and they said that this is pier cap the microphone doesn work at all he can talk to any of his friends return it but my time is more valuable than this item if your kid is little and he doesn have any friends to talk to this might last week or two but besides that he was pretty upset wouldn buy it if were you had to order him different set so just my opinion if you don know what you re looking for don get this mon doesn know ,125,5.0
positive,these headphones are comfortable and the noise concealing is great the sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mid the only issue is the wires it impossible to use the lights through the us and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my lawton because the us and headphones insects are on opposite sides and the wire isn long enough which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that too short the extended they give with the product also seems cheap the sound through the headphones with the extended is completely missed up to the point of it being unable none of these problems are with the headphones itself so still gave stars but it annoying that can use every feature included honestly the product is solid stars ,147,1.0

neutral,good,1,4.0
negative,this gazing heads does not light up when you play this only lights up when plugged in to the us for charging only initially bought it because thought the led would show when gazing which is the main purpose but was wrong plus the tables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad wouldn recommend buying this cheap mid ,66,5.0
neutral,this is not bluetooth product even though it shows up in results as bluetooth ,14,4.0

neutral,you can hear the box audit in headphones but to sound still plays ,13,5.0
positive,i got my heads few days after ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so notified them and right then and there they replaced it with red one as requested because it just goes along with my computer no questions asked the heads looks awesome love the lights anyway besides the awesome lights this has got to be one of the most decent sound wise quality and most awesome looking headsets out there and for very sweet price mean price like that for heads like this is very cheap repeat the price is very cheap for what this headphone worth if you re game and do not want to spend cap ton of money for decent heads you might want to try this ,128,3.0
neutral, no snuffing in the box to keep the product for bounding around in the box which came with debts all in it which can cause the product to become damaged in transit it seems like an issue they could easily address it advertised sound quality that it could not deliver on the sound quality is terribly poor it sounded like was listening to the to instead of heads even though the sound was coming from the heads this is with the volume on the heads turned all the way up it was advertised as heads that can be used with gazing console you need us for the lights but the chord for that is splints from the aux input and the chord is only inches after the split meaning if you re using controller your not able to enjoy the full experience of the heads because you would need to be have the controller inches from the us source not to mention the lights aren as bright as advertised in the pictures it advertising noise isolation mid personal testing found this to be false not only could hear the video was listening to on couture but could hear my air conditioning in the background not what would call noise isolation some people said the heads was too small found it to be too big in my experience either that or they are just too loose because of the adding quality on the ears can shake my head slightly and it ll fall right off when game like to immense myself in the game which might mean small quick movements and leaning side to side that would cause the heads to fall off your head watch video for demonstration speaking of the adding on the ears that might be what causes this heads to not be noise concealing my bl ear buds have more noise concealing capabilities than this heads does could still hear when someone opened the front door to my building while playing my game will be returning these and requesting refund ,343,1.0
neutral,hobby says these are more come to wear than the ones bought him last christmas he plays cod and said that they cancel out the noise of the household going on around him and he able to wear them for several hours without them hurting his ears or head at all ,51,1.0

positive,stopped working two days after we received them but the customer service is amazing ,14,1.0
neutral,amazing heads but my only complaint is the people talking to me in discord were hearing themselves talk through the heads and into my mid back to them so had to work on and fix that beside that no complaints,40,4.0
positive,i can fattest to how noise concealing they are or the sound quality my kiss took them out of the box hated how short the mid was so returned them otherwise think they would ve worked just fine but we had headphones like these at one point in time supposedly bc the mid is too short it doesn come fully at the mouth others you re gazing with have hard time hearing you this is review from kid game who shouts at everyone so sure that if they can hear you bc the mid is too far away then that gospel truth in gazing land ,105,5.0

neutral,purchased to of these for myself and wife for the price can complain had them for few months as of now still operating fine,24,5.0
neutral,this is decent heads if you re using it for pp gazing there is no noise cancellation the loudest volume is not that loud to be honest the led lights needs the us to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller you can use it for plantation or box but you can use led unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with us port guess should have expected this since it wasn too expensive although for this product think the price is lot this is equivalent to dollar heads based on sound quality no noise cancellation and the led lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you re playing on plantation ,128,3.0
positive,i ve had many headsets over the years and this one sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid prices headsets however the quality of the outdoing sound from the microphone is horrible have played with the same group of friends and they can barely tolerate the sound of my voice when playing ve tried taking the voice settings on my computer and have been unable to fix it when using my old heads there aren any issues other than microphone quality the heads it above average ,91,5.0

positive,son loves playing with his friends and enjoys the sound quality of the heads he uses it on is ,19,5.0
positive, bought for gentle pp game girl this heads is pretty good one would say the microphone kind of sounds like you re talking on master so would recommend getting separate mid set if you re planning to use these for streaming or making video the volume control is located on the cord the only complaint have is that it occasionally gets stuck in the arm of my chair and lowers itself the lights are not colored it looks to just be regular led lights in plastic causing so if you re buying these for someone who rages at games they could very easily break them ,105,1.0

neutral,good,1,1.0
positive,constant clinking sounds and static over the microphone this product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap mm design with no c over it the sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound maybe you can get lucky and get headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even little bump here or there will easily knock it off place good luck taking your chances with this product ,88,5.0
neutral,no sound and hard to talk,6,1.0

positive,love the over all side and make of the unit the mid has no problem and one you set the volume to hear others on the phone or computer you are good to go th long chord is bit much for close phone use so the velcro tax was helpful till set tie ran as lookout or in my wheel chair dose not need trip hazards ,66,1.0
positive,the microphone is too short so if you have big head the people or talking to won be able to hear you ,22,1.0
neutral,poor sound quality like if someone stuffed paper towel or cotton ball in it ,14,3.0
neutral,they were decently sounding with good amount of noise cancellation however these were more intended for pp because there is two cords one for sound and one for the lights the cord is too short to connect it to the is also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gazing ,55,5.0
positive,solid gazing heads for very good price over the ear provides good noise cancellation the plastic materials used in the heads feel little cheap but ve had my heads for the last few years and it still works well,39,4.0

negative,hostile never worked be careful they fool u,8,5.0
neutral,this heads is so big and bulky especially for kid the audit is fine and is better than most budget headsets the mid started having static issues after months every time you slightly move the cable the static is incredibly loud through the mid to the people you re playing with that tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together ,64,5.0
positive,when got this immediately ran into problems with the mid my friends couldn hear me and could barely hear them it never picked up my voice no matter how loudly spoke they would hear every other word but never the complete sentence tried to work with it for weeks but ended up using my webcam mid for while because it sounded better and could be heard ,66,5.0

neutral,noise cancellation is what my grandson liked,7,5.0
neutral,gift,1,2.0
positive,really nice heads the only note ve got is if you are using this for is the us placement to power up the lights on the heads is right next to the audit jack like connected away not very practical and you have to put us extension on it if you want to power up the lights could care less about the lights so ve got high marks for this great noise cancellation sound is crisp and heads is very comfortable ,81,4.0
neutral,worked well at first few months later all oncoming sounds came in sounding like the speakers were blown they just keep getting worse it so difficult understanding people ,28,5.0

positive,this is great heads for the price it does what need it to do,14,1.0
neutral,volume level needs to be high for microphone to work normally but the high volume has way too much base and hurts your ears plus the ear puffs are too small need to spend about or more on quality headsets like gastro turtle beach or other bands ,47,5.0

positive,i like the head phone the sound is good ,9,3.0
neutral,the good decent sound quality and relatively comfortable the bad uses an analogy jack for the speakers making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add on like splitter the microphone is an flexible piece of plastic and people talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted overall overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones ,64,4.0
negative,at the start noticed that they weren that loud even with the volume on ignored it though because it wasn that bad regret doing that because now they got even lower with the sound on this product isn worth buying ,40,3.0

positive,great for people who game clot,6,5.0
positive,i like stuff loud bit of an audiophile but don like spending lot unless it worth it prefer cheap and effective and that is this used to use the official plantation tireless headphones that cost over and those were great but then they stopped charging and got these freed up the us port that was being used by the tireless headphones because these headphones plug into the tireless controller so for lot less money it still tireless and they sound great ,81,5.0

positive,i had been looking for gazing heads for my is casual game and was looking for something that could use when play late at night read the reviews for this product and convinced me to buy when received it was surprised how big the headphones are but it wasn big deal when tried them on they felt comfortable and have been using them for long period of time and my ears have not gotten tired the sound quality is surprisingly good with good bass and can hear the surround sound effects of my games the voice chat quality is very good with clear quality in terms of noise cancellation it not true noise cancellation can still hear sounds form outside when playing but it minimal overall pleased with these headphones as they do their job just fine ,137,1.0
positive,they are pretty good,4,3.0
neutral,headphones are slightly uncomfortable to wear and the mid isn very good mine broke quickly after few weeks with seemingly no explanation that being said the sound quality is ok and these are ok headphones for beginners ,37,1.0
neutral,very nice and sturdy just heavy on head ,8,5.0
negative,the heads is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and us connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the us is connected to power source poor design of the cord ,93,4.0
neutral,strictly gazing,2,2.0

positive,this product was little disappointing to be honest for one wish had paid attention to the fact that this is not tireless second the lights don come on with mid jack which sure it wouldn make sense to but it really should have just been us with an adapted otherwise if you don care about lights it works fine say it better suited for pp gazing since usually there mid jack next to us port but not for console its not the worst just the sound quality is kind of minimal it doesn play music too well it can get loud but then the sound gets shrill and will induce headache truthfully wouldn buy this again ,116,1.0

neutral,i recently ordered these headphones after having logitech heads go out on me after few weeks of owning them for the price they are really good ,26,1.0
positive,keep in mind this is my first benton heads so assume it rare case however this was not great first impression was using it on my pp but it probably works best as console heads the heads itself looks great the speaker sounds nice and love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mid buttons on the cable as well unfortunately that all positive comments can give the set pp did not connect to the heads no matter if enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to rest not only that it takes attempts to open the pp needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it then it didn even recognize the heads at all no option to configure or anything trying to use another pp for the set was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports when finally got connected to the mid was greeted with the sound of rain like static that was louder than my own voice volume the volume of the mid itself was so low needed to increase it to the maximum value it also has default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable was hoping to replace my pp gazing heads but can say feel confident buying this one ,223,4.0
neutral,it works good for year but after the mid went out had to order new adapted and month later the mid stopped working again the adapted was ,27,5.0
neutral,this is by far the worst head set ve yet to get only two weeks in and absolutely despised it the mid is way to far away from your mouth even with sensitivity all the way up my friends could barely hear me it fixed mid all it can do is go up and down far to stiff feels like vice around my head mid quality is garage sounds fanny and fully honestly you can buy better headsets for the same price not as good but better than this dumpster fire of heads at least it ll make decent target practice,101,5.0
positive,they fit very well and have amazing sound quality very long cord as well recommend ton ,16,5.0
neutral,for the price can complain good beginner heads for game,10,1.0

neutral,has way to much static and chooses when it wants to work ,12,5.0
positive,i am an adult with smaller head and sometimes feel like these headphones are slipping off when gazing but that is really the only complaint have tend to just use one of my pennies to keep it from slipping don like the cautery headphones they make for smaller heads that why chose this one otherwise like these headphones clot ,59,5.0
positive,my boys love to game on their computer box and intend switch this heads is great for all gazing experience great sound and microphone the only reason did not give it stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn give the star experience have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out the price for the quality of the product is worth it ,78,4.0
neutral,i have year and month with mine and haven run in any issues so far ,15,4.0
positive,my husband enjoys moves however his taste and my taste aren the same since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying movie on his lawton while watching movie on to my husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good as far as noise concealing he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he watching pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson ,84,5.0

neutral,i bought this because it is gazing headphone and the reviews looked to be good quality however plugged it into my pp and at first only the audit output was working and recognized on my computer when plugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized the sound stopped working ran troubleshoot program and the pp doesn even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack looked online its very common problem ,77,1.0
neutral,i seen in the description that it said it would work for box one went no further after receiving the head phone we noticed it did not work for box one so opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapted is needed for box one and it is dont buy these for box as between this and the adapted you will spend almost ,65,1.0

neutral,i bought this for my son for microphone to talk to his friends on is the microphone does not work at all ,22,5.0

positive,bought these after my kiss broke my sonya gold heads while these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being tireless expected step down in quality as was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kiss and cats could learn to mind others things while they are step down surprised at how much like them like the volume control on the cord rather than the heads so can see if it if need to and while not as great they do have some noise cancellation there isn much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point think that would be asking for too much overall happy with them and until feel the need to get more expensive pair these will be what use will definitely hold onto them as back pair if ever do upgrade as well ,159,1.0

negative,the sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but ve noticed something after couple of weeks of use the ear pieces aren comfortable for adults due to them being too small and what even worse is that wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gazing have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort so warning not recommended with glasses and or adults ,85,1.0

neutral,day used it on my gazing pp huge issues this heads by default will default itself to the speakers microphone on your pp lawton under the default settings making it very hard to make games and discord to detect the heads and ultimately luck you re stream setting abilities after hours of middling with settings finally was able to make it work correctly day doesn work at all now microphone works but the heads now doesn produce any sound and yes did make sure my volume was turned all the way up through the hardware and software sides understand that chose cheap product to fulfill my needs of heads but don out right sell faulty and useless product waste of time and money ,123,5.0
neutral,just arrived and my son was so excited we plug it into the sonya is controller not off brand and nobody can hear him chat in fortnight my husband plugged it into his phone and the microphone worked why not the is that what we bought it for so it basically useless for our needs ,55,4.0

neutral,for the price it good to use for gazing with other players over the is system,16,3.0
negative,i just got these mind ago and tried them first off it doesn light up unless you plug both ends into port which means console players won get the light up second it just all around horrible with its sound thee most quiet whisper like sound bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn come close to standards don know if this is just defective or what but this ain it and am quite disappointed in the money just gave to company that couldn even hold standard for gazing ,96,5.0
positive,is came with one side of the heads not working then when speaking into the mid the other party couldn hear what was being said recommend maybe different one if this worked for you great but on my end it didn the box came little beat up looking too also very light weight feel like they would have broke easily sent it back for refund ,65,5.0

neutral,mute button does not work,5,1.0
neutral,product doesn work,3,3.0
positive,st off this product advertised as if there are lights on it there aren its just stick that doesn have any led function very misleading nd the heads is very poorly made the earpieces barely fit my year old they are far too small to fit an adults ears rd the sound quality is supper takes lot of adjustment and you get better quality from an box default heads do not buy this ,73,2.0
positive,got these today and not sure if should even use them specially after learning most it reviews are face bought new console along side these and not going to risk losing new controller if the adapted decides to break off inside it like some reviews say the first red flag for me was definitely the packing it was packed in large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial there was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use and the worst part is you don even have to use them in game to tell the mid is defective as it won even reach the front of you re face the cord as well as volume slide are bit obnoxious in size and the product overall feels like fragile plastic off brand did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good noticed background static at first which lot of people mentioned but it wasn terrible or even noticeable at times ll probably smash these away for back pair and just buy name brand pair for the same or even better price and if you are also looking for solid gazing heads then please help yourself and look away from these ,204,5.0
positive,loved the heads incredible sound,5,5.0
positive,great headphones,2,4.0
neutral,so just got these today and was excited however upon setting them up noticed that the light up function is only unable when looking up the attached us to the port on my is stupidly enough there isn enough cable split to also connect the headphones to your controller in order to use the headphones for its sole purpose it either they light up on the damn counter and look cut or you talk to friends while playing online but there is no both so can you say complete design flaw false advertisement and bottom line this company needs to close shop and go lip burghers ,106,3.0

positive,i love this and it works great you can adjust the sound and mute your mid very easily the only down side is that you need us port to make it light up it really does not matter if it lighted up or not but play on is and only have remote don have pp to plug the us into to make it light up but overall love it ,69,3.0
positive,had few issues but customer service was awesome problem was resolved immediately overall would buy heads again ,17,1.0

neutral,my son like this for playing online games on his box had previous turtle heads that he loved but that had gotten damage after long use this item was confusing to use there separate us cord plug adapted that can be plugged in if you re using it on lawton or computer that will also make the unit light up but the lights only work if the us cord is plugged in during play sound often times would not work and microphone would intermittently cut in and out update now works better after resecting and dating controller for box volume and on off switches bulky and uncomfortable returning product going to buy another turtle,114,5.0
positive,friend who this was bought for said the headphones had good sound quality from his games he was playing but the microphone is muffled and you can barely make out what he saying through voice chat probably ok if you don care about being heard the design looks nice enough ,50,5.0

positive,i bought it for my boyfriend and his exact words where the quality is juice meaning it was the best choice for him to do his gazing,27,1.0
positive,my son is happy with this heads set easily and sound great ,12,1.0
positive,the sound quality on these is absolutely terrible for gazing tried them with music as well also terrible the volume wheel is upside down backwards the mid is worthless and not working properly the led lights are worthless for gazing on anything other than pp it is one cord with very small split at the end one to go into the controller and the other is us for the lights to work but you can use the lights and play on the is or box at the same time which makes these pretty painless in that aspect there is no noise cancellation whatsoever out of would not recommend these look and sound nice when you read the description and reviews but they are absolute trash wouldn even buy them for my kiss ,132,1.0
positive,for the price it works fine and is comfortable can wear it for hours and it doesn hurt have no idea about noise concealing not an audiophile or anything but it sounds fine to me for my needs have asked people on the other end if the mid sounds good and they say they can hear me fine it is loud enough but do wish it was able to get even louder for some uses rating it stars for filling my needs but stars on the gazing scale because while can hear footsteps and surround sound sure it must not be as good as turtle beach or something ve also had it for years and no issues no idea about the lights because ve never plugged that in ,128,5.0
positive,the heads barely fit on my head after constant adjustment and taking would have to put pair of socks on top of my head in order for it to be comfortable and fit ,33,3.0
positive,cool looking comfortable light weight ,5,5.0
positive,i wrote negative review for this purchase company reached out to me and offered replacement free of charge while really appreciate the replacement found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original happy sound is not an ideal way to immense yourself into game truly appreciate the company effort but can recommend this product ,58,5.0
neutral,this thing sucks you have to be to close to the system for comfort tried it on my is and it doesn work at all for is not satisfied especially with how close to have to be to use the head set in the is because in order to turn it on it has to be plugged into the back and the cord to plug into the controller isn very long at all so my hands had to be right up in the is and it wasn comfortable at all,90,5.0
positive,grandkids are enjoying this ,4,5.0
neutral,do not buy,3,5.0
positive,perfect sound and quality perfect for those who are looking good heads ,12,1.0
positive,for gazing and even for non gazing grip have about this heads is the volume and mid controller it like you have remote control super glued on the cord and it swing around and knocks up against your arm or chair the us cable is also an annoying addition it cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don need to waste the energy for the lights it an additional cord just hanging off of your lawton or desktop so the design could definitely be better as for the noise cancellation not completely sure what noise concealing these headsets actually have tested the mid and even with the mid all the way up you have to mentally mute yourself using the volume controller otherwise people can still hear you but you will seem like you re far away from the computer the sound quality is okay played games and watched moves with these while watching shows moves with just the aux mm jack did notice some voice echoing this isn super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this the heads does have bushy adding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears these might be more of on ear headphones rather than over ear ones the cushion does eventually hurt to keep the heads on for an extended period of time but hoping after wearing the cushion down bit the comfortability will increase overall the heads is okay since got it on sale it decent set of headphones ,268,5.0
positive,i love it soon as got it got on the game and got my first win in free for all oh the led lights only come on when plug em in or game so,34,5.0

negative,the sound is going in and out shake the heads and the sound reconnects then it gone for the majority of the time terrible quality doesn last long at all ,30,5.0
positive, update have finally tried with my pp and tried on both mine and my husbands and the sound works fine it not very noise concealing but it is nice to hear the base and actually pick up on detail otherwise wouldn have heard without it the downfall is that the mid won work at all of course played with the tongue and made sure it wasn my computer settings and it still isn working put in for return so hopefully this one is defective and the new heads will be better super summed because really wanted to like this heads bought this gazing heads specifically for my is and as advertised it states that it is compatible and it is not have the original sonya is controller so it not even like using off brand ve tried with both of my controller and nothing have not tried with my pp yet will update my review once try it with the pp,161,5.0
positive,i bought these for work they allow me to lookout most of the conversations in the room and allow me to focus on my own thoughts sound quality is good listen to music audiobooks and participate in video conferences they are not too heavy am able to wear them all day with my mask and eyeglasses they do not apply extra pressure to me ears ,65,3.0

neutral,it gets the job done,5,1.0
neutral,upon receiving these was so excited to see these lit up while use them to game on my box the design of them is usually appealing upon undoing the pink looked little cheap but sure the other colors with black would have been better was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into us which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short so that was big after being summed about that shrugged it off and started gazing with them anyway got minutes into my game when sound started breaking up another minutes later and they completely stopped working tested my old heads just to be sure and the old worked verifying the heads was june sending back and paying the extra for turtle beach ,144,5.0
positive,i use these for gazing music video schoolbook pretty much everything spanning both pp and console experiences they work great and still work great after almost year of ownership the chord is had unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren ideal for noise concealing other than that can find any issues ,52,1.0

positive,great customer service and decent heads for the price ,9,5.0
neutral,not worth it if you re looking for something to work longer than couple of months my son was able to get couple of months use out of it before the mid stopped working then he would have to hold the cord certain way for him to hear out of one side it wasn worth doing all that so we tossed it since was passed the return deadline would be very weary of those so called stars reviews ,78,5.0

neutral,sound is muffled lights vagrant but useless unless you re connecting to lawton for gazing the split is too short to connect it to the console what makes it light up and simultaneously to the gazing controller what makes it useful so for gazing the lights will not be on while wearing the heads mid like so many other complaints doesn work returning this item ,65,5.0

positive,i used these headphones mainly for gazing on my plantation but they worked just as good on my pp ve bought more expensive gazing headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise concealing but it not bad the long chord gives you room for gazing from distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed the led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is nice addition ,86,1.0

negative,i didn expect too much but the heads broke within week ,11,5.0
positive,i am by no means heads snow have some specification that want met for gazing heads these headphones check lot of boxes but not all of them unfortunately will be looking for new heads because the microphone is pretty muffled am in party chat days week my friends have stated that the mid is muffled and kind of muddy louder sounds make their way through the mid for example gunshot loud animal calls in hunting game loud screams effects from scar game etc the mid is fixed this is obvious with the photo but didn realize how much it would effect me can adjust how close or far the mid is from my mouth and therefore can really try to fix mid quality the plastic quality is eh it feels little cheaper but you get what you re paying for with budget heads the bass was not all that impressive have had lot worse but also much better as well say it bass rating and this is one of the most important features for me everything else about the heads is great but don recommend it for gazing with friends their best features include long braided cord crisp loud and powerful sound comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs great designcons fixed mid bad mid quality not best for really small losing sound quality or really large losing comfort head lacking amazing bass,233,1.0
positive,lasted about months we bought cheap heads knowing they wouldn last long my son is hard in headsets so at this point it better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don last good quality for the value,44,2.0

negative,couldn beat the price on this heads just wanted something cheap that would work decent of course it seems like pretty cheap plastic but it doesn really bother me they don hurt my head ears or anything like that when wear them for long periods of time unlike other headphones headsets they light up which is cool but you can plug that part into controller because it us for the lighting overall haven had any complaints from the people play with online no comments about how bad it sounds or anything so assuming the mid works just fine and so does the sound that comes through the heads ,108,1.0
positive,i received the motion each by benton headphones last christmas as gift thought for sure these were headphones when tried them on my is they sounded great and gave my girlfriend peace because she now did not have to hear dr constantly could fish ride horses hunt and have shootouts with outlaws all day long do not play online so cannot say to the microphone quality but have used it few times on room calls and no one had issues hearing me am also musician and filmmaker and am very pick about sound quality let be clear crystal clear get it these are not sennheiser headphones but they are very good quality for the price for casual use could not believe the price when looked them up would edit an album or film with these yes for rough cutting but would grab something more reputable for sound final mixing for video and definitely not use these for sound mixing music the mix coming out of these is little on the bass side for me but not enough one couldn get used to in few minutes and only know they are slightly bass because my ear is trained to hear that stuff most people will not notice this at all they have lasted just fine for year and are still going light plastic body but nothing has fallen off it yet also take very good care of my things and do not toss them on tables couches etc so cannot speak to how robust they are for people who like to throw things across rooms do not ever pull on the cord etc mine came with split connection mm us which does come in handy sometimes but the extra angry cord not being used can be annoying also the cord is waaaaay long feet is which is great and also annoying depending on your usage but would take more cord than not enough any day the in line volume knob is great for when different streaming services like to pump out different volumes and your ears get blasted when your show starts no need to get up and change the computer volume just lay on the couch and adjust the dial on the cord severely the dial is great to pump up the volume bit for those highly compressed video on the web that are too low to hear overall it gets stars if it had treble bass adjustment knob it would get cheers to your ears ,416,5.0
neutral,i like everything about them,5,3.0

negative,i bought these about year ago and when received them they appeared to be fine but when used them the cord is heavy thick and tugging the worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindled and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself used them for about hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and noticed in video clip saved the microphone cut out random but audit still coming through the heads and was confused because never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tingling asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn realized that he bought the same pair but figured give them another shot once again they tangled themselves to death one day and realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are if there is anything in this review you note down do not but these headphones the worst part is them tingling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord quite embarrassing for the company to own such terrible product ,227,4.0

positive,on the outside this heads looks great and fits comfortably not sure if mine is defective or just had something come loose in shipping but it doesn quite work right the microphone works fine and the left apiece works fine the rights side is where the problem is have to move the cord just right to hear out of it if this was heads say it fine but for feel like should at least be able to hear out of both sides without having to do you position to get it to work properly overall say it not bad but also not great do with that what you will ,109,3.0

positive,ok so just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it the heads is acceptable especially given the current pricetag but it not great it really not have sensitive ears had problems with them relating to heat and pressure so avoided headphones sets for while but eventually saw how for the world of gazing headsets dominate over earbuds so have been on the lookout for comfortable one ever since ll beating around the bush there know no more swear good the top nearest part is very soft and squishy we like this it blue love blue the cord is well made doesn look like it tearing daytime soon bad they re not that comfortable they re not tortuous but have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear game sound is very average can hear decently but for games like fortunate that have bad audit to begin with this isn going to change anything ugly don know if this is defect but if you plug this into your phone or tablet and bend the cord ll while on call it ll hang up you watching couture video cord moves slightly and it ships to the next video you see how infuriating this can be it pronged connection they have added us connection only for the lights get it but at the same time just remove the lighting no one wants to have us cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pp the mid doesn mute when you lip it up thought this was an industry standard but apparently not you have to mentally mute your mid with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord so that pretty much it honestly you be getting around the same quality with clearance pair at your local electronics store and without the very annoying end call bug would have returned but was too lazy eh it ll work as back suppose edit benton customer service took the initiative and contracted me giving out refund to my amazement was concerned it was possibly scar but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever huge thanks to benton for having the service more popular companies should have ,374,1.0

positive,i think they are good especially for the price but wish that they were more adjustable they are great for sitting up and listening to to or gazing but if you want to lay down or have them adjusted to your head they are not good they feel bulky and don quite fit to my head for someone with slightly larger head they may fit however with them not being adjustable think my problem would be slipped if someone with really large head put them on as they are not adjustable also the two connection types with one cord hanging all the time is just huge bother and it is definitely design flaw there should be some way to tuck the unused connection up so it doesn angle and become nuisance sound noise concealing and upright use is all good though gave it because of these factors ,147,4.0
neutral,in order for your lights to work you would need him extended to connect to your controller and or outlet,20,1.0

positive,i don like the fact that the mike doesn pick up voice very well its about half the reason why bought it the overall construction is not very sturdy the plastic is brittle the less work as advertised but it takes an entire us port so you need three open ports on the front of the pp just to have the headphones work with features the headphones themselves are uncomfortable and not better than the cheap heads was using before the audit quality isn great pro they look cool but that about it don pay full price for these glad didn ,101,5.0

neutral,use for gazing noise cancellation could be better ,8,2.0
positive,this is great for beginner games the heads is come which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headache from the pressure it does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear bit which prefer since would like to know if being spoken to when playing but you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room like that you can use in the pp and is because the heads jack works with the is remote like others mentioned the us has to be connected to light up for us we don mind the light not being lit up so it not big issue after all when you are the user you really don look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare only issue had which isn big issue is the mute for the mid isn easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gazing for those times when you want to be mute so others don hear every background noise or family talking so find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing fas games and in an intense section but that might be me not able to multitask that quickly ll just wished the mute button was button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren stumbling trying to slide plus it doesn really feel like it sides all the way so you are double checking know went into depth of the issue but it isn huge issue just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration overall love it going to buy couple more for our gazing family ,309,2.0

positive,overall the set is fine nothing ridiculous you get what you pay for pretty much just needed fair prices pair to replace my blown out ones perhaps my biggest grip about this product is that the volume knob is total joke there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn on the way to turning it up the majority of the time you re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting the range feels like it begins and ends within less than third of the knob ability to turn in the volume increase direction ,107,2.0

neutral,i was trying to play the is with my friend but couldn here him and he couldn here me ,19,1.0
positive,i did lot of research on amazon looking for new cheaper gazing heads for my son he seems to have the worst luck when it comes to cheaper gazing headsets but guess you get what you pay for however with these they work great sound quality is good voice and mute work good the lights do not light up unless you have the us cord connected to another source my son uses his for the is so no lights for us doesn really matter though since he cannot see the lights anyway they work and that what matters most the extra connection does come in the box ,107,5.0

positive,these do not fit on the head well my head falls under the size fits most category in terms of hats glasses and headsets this does not additional they do not cancel any noise at all finally the one received had to have the mid put right to my mouth to pick up any sounds no matter how much played around with the settings understand that this is cheap pair but that doesn mean that the product shouldn work sound quality is alright ,83,3.0

positive,got these as an intended upgrade for previous heads got from palmar wasn expecting much but wish had kept the palmar heads now that ve tested these they work just fine for video playback no real complaints there my main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how clumsy the microphone is the store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my lawton and this microphone my lawton consistently provides louder clearer results compared to this heads there was still quite noticeable background noise in the heads recording as well there also some design flaws with how the microphone is implements it is completely rigid peace of plastic that only rotated vertically so it just ends up hanging good to inches from your mouth when deployed yes got out ruler and measured it that off this is compared to other heads miss which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer and in front of your mouth instead of beside it the cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw simply put the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of cheap toy the case on the connecting band is bit better being made from matter plastic but not by much the only things on this device that don feel like they were slapped together for as low material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the mm audit jack and the us that powers the contractual obliged game lights have honestly foregone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing and microphone that actually somewhat flexible so can actually hear myself speak overall average playback quality nothing that would impress an audiophile but nowhere near terrible it painfully average and unfortunately that more than can be said for the rest of the device bad microphone design and quality just don bother got better results from the built in microphone array in my thinkpad from than did with this thing el cheap feel like toy from dollar store verdict if you care about quality in your heads don buy this they sell this thing for at regular price got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount even still somewhat regret spending money on this thing and be leagues more disappointed had paid the full asking price for it it barely worth it weight at is dollars and there no way it worth the normal if you just want something for discreet audit playback go find better heads or just settle for some earbuds there plenty of decent option for the latter under both in retail stores and online this one isn worth your time or your money the only reason even keeping this is because returning products has always been pain in my experience and because the heads itself technically works but that it it not even worth the haste of chasing down refund ,510,4.0

positive,great heads for the money,5,1.0
positive,i ordered two pairs of these headphones one for me and another for my brother not even two weeks and they ve already ran their course at first they were bit tight on the head enough to give headache if not removed after few hours this eventually ceased up as the first week went on the real issue came in for us days after first using them like many others have been saying here one day the mid was fine and the next day all of sudden its quality was way lower than what it was prior audit then coming through lot more stuffy and the mid having hard time picking up any sounds at all only when cracked up the decided settings to max it was able to pick up faint sounds one of them still works fine on our box but when it comes to pp they re both on the way out already will most definitely be looking elsewhere for our teach needs in the future ,169,5.0
neutral,this heads is the worst for gazing no sterno so there is no difference if the enemy is on the right or left you can hear it as one sound the noise cancellation is amazing to the point you are screaming just so people can hear you talking normal sound quality is ok besides that useless hanging us plug for lights don have small head and don have huge head and it sides down off my ears after some time it snug for about an hour super light weight plastic june when received them thought what was in the box was pack of mass wait and save your money and buy something that is actually worth your money for years to come ,122,5.0

positive,you get very good quality mid for solid all around and the sound noise cancellation was better than expected only problem is the mid isn that maneuverable and sometimes my friends can hear me that good when have it close to my mouth,43,5.0
neutral,i bought these for my daughter they worked well for the first months and then suddenly the sound quality became happy and distorted unable to use them waste of money,30,5.0

neutral,bought this heads in february and it stopped working no sound comes through the heads at all in april but my son didn tell me about it until july st he used it for his is ,36,4.0
positive,a bit heavy and awkward but would expect that at this price point my only real complaint is in the cord design am using with is and the cord splints in one is mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound which works fine the other is us jack that supplies power to the led lights and should plug into the console the problem is that the cord splints at the last inches or so if you want to use the us for the lights you need to either buy separate us extension or keep your controller at least inches from your console which is very practical if not impossible just bad design it should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time had stars but lowered to because don like companies that offer money for reviews they ve been sending incessant email saying they will refund if remove my review how about you just make decent product my integrity can be bought for ,179,5.0

neutral,the microphone too quiet,4,3.0
positive,a pretty decent heads bought this heads having very very high hopes for the mid specifically since my audit hadn been the best just through my lawton microphone but after using this heads for month or two have realized that the mid isn actually that great it is mediocre at best and it commonly cuts out in voice calls the heads audit quality itself is honestly pretty good the mute and volume wheel were very convenient and you could really make your audit very loud with the volume wheel which was plus will say though that the led lights on the heads wont light up unless you plus the us jack in which was big inconvenience for me when was still using wired mouse and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe just forgot to check the sides when buying this heads is also very very bulky which is personal sick for me when buying headsets its definitely not for minimalistic look but will say this is just personal preference overall its mediocre heads since its only you get what you pay for but there definitely better headsets out there for the same price or save up just bit more money for highquality medium prices heads like the rarer taken steelseries arctic or hyper cloud alpha heads ,221,2.0

neutral,the headsets volume is terrible and the people you play with will barely be able to hear you even if you max the output volume on it the sound quality is also terrible as it random simplifies certain sounds and makes everyone sound like they are talking into cup overall dont buy this even though its cheap it is not worth as you wont be able to even function with this hung of june ,74,5.0

neutral,this product has to be plugged into the box and controller at the sometime to work it has about inches of cord making it impossible to play any games ,29,4.0
negative,i bought these because play rags via discord and wanted better mid than my galaxy buds because sometimes they don pick up my voice from the very first night used this heads people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mid it was quite distracting and ended up having to switch to my earbuds thought that was weird maybe just problem with discord but would try some solutions and see if could get them to work used them little since then and no one said anything but kept myself mute unless was actually speaking then my boyfriend complained about hearing couture through the mid to the point where it was very loud for him when could barely hear the video myself wondered if it might be my malbrook pro did some research to see if there was setting could change or anything else to fix the problem nothing did then thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews after reading them convinced the heads has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around starting the process of returning them through amazon because don have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction bring on the cash offers but this review is going nowhere ,224,5.0

positive,the sound quality is ok and by that mean there is some surround sound left right but not so much full direction and that pretty important to know teammates said mid sounded ok downside is the mid is short and stiff maybe that will protect it better the mid is adequate and good for the price now for the meat of this review the ear covers are stiff and tiny they wrap around my year old ears great not mine though it actually painful to wear these longer than minutes so don plan to game long with these if you have tiny ears or are under years old then these are for you of you re an adult move on ended up spending more for rarer taken heads and org let me tell you for the price think got the value the sound quality of the rarer heads is just miles ahead of these garage bengoos you try these trash bengoos and then try some rarer rakes with surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference not just in sound quality but also in build quality the mid the comfort of the ear puffs just now would have paid the price difference if knew beforehand how big difference there is between trash cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like rarer never going back from rarer ll buy them again and again for life now that know ,240,1.0

negative,i use these headphones for my at home job as well as gazing and often get complaints from my customers that they cannot hear me actually bought these headphones to replace different pair of gazing headphones and do have less complaints about my audit with these headphones but even just one complaint is still pretty bad ,56,5.0
positive,the sound quality is decent but the mid doesn work that well so if you need mid to play with friends wouldn recommend this ,24,5.0
positive,i ve had these for about years now and they still feel and sound great good choice for standard cheap heads or general pp users plastic is light and flexible good for long play sessions cord is strong even after few bishops with my chair wheel good sound quality not an expert in sound mixing but know what bad headphones sound like rarely use the mid but it functional and the mute switch still holds solidcons cord may be strong but it prone to bending in weird ways it may just be how rapped my cord around the back of my neck but it caused part of it to form rigid curve the volume control is little loose and will sometimes rise or lower if brushed against noise concealing is effective but not perfect about what you expect though depending on what you want this could be positive led is barely feature it either takes up us port or the plug dangles from the back of your pp or the bottom of your controller,174,5.0

neutral,you cannot turn the speaker off without it making loud noise they know it annoying it meant to get you to install the pp if you install the pp giving up more of yourself to them in other words they let you turn it off think it meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to and cannot hear anything else it will still make loud noise when turning off they want you to not be able to turn it off quietly for example when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on want to turn it off quietly works fine otherwise the one star is just cause think it fair to penalized such behavior ,128,5.0

positive,it an adequate speaker for this price point ll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine do not feel like wasted money but if when buy another of these types of speakers it won be bl it been at least years since ve bought one of these it speakers and my last speaker was just as loud clear cost less had features that just worked and even came with innyard for easy carry this thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands volume and sound quality it loud in room with no absent noise my music is mostly rock like metallic planters white combine like loud music and for my private office it perfect ll mostly listen at volume so can think but it nice to jam out sometimes at middle volume level the sound is the best lows vs high above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the high are increased volume wise you could use this in an environment with absent noise like warehouse or kitchen but you would need to stay around if you want to really enjoy what is playing after it probably going to sound more like noise than music phone conductivity is simple for music just push top button but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker had in the price point there are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this the manual certainly is no help but it not what needed it for just liked it as nice side feature used sometimes with my last speaker like this battery life is fine haven done complete testing on this it does have pretty significant battery in it for the charge your device option but his maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music won need it for longer than his most of the time so doubt this will come up as an issue for me there an pp but it does very little for this speaker most useful feature is digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker thankful for it main function of it connecting and playing music it pretty basic and simple if you go the route of multiple speakers reads the reviews for the pp on how to make that work it is not intuition it series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews ,425,5.0

positive,so originally was introduced to bl speakers when the charge first came out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been telling any and everyone come across that when ever in question go with bl so this last christmas someone caught me the bl lip and was just confused the sound quality the base even the bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song returned no problem only wanted replacement anyway received the second one and again like the bl look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the charge so after getting refund from the second lip spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the sound that made me fan to begin with if you re just trying out bl speakers would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the charge models see that the lip and have almost perfect rating on amazon so maybe it just my opinion but believe the quantity all around of the charge is better representative of the bl brand the battery in the charge seems to drain quicker than the lip but put my speaker threw it passes from the moment turn it on in the morning until am ready to relax in the evening literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth connection no problem at all the sound quality is just awesome love music period believe music is the best and purest way to control moods mentally emotional spiritually and even physically listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blue country ran etc have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in base the lyric will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe or pushes of the button if you re listening to say or blue guitar albert king for example it only gets better the higher you go earth brooks or laurel daily just over half way of volume and the vocal and piano will be front and center and so on even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back ratio or yard man can wait till can get enough for the extreme or the boom box hope this was helpful to someone god bless,402,5.0

positive,i bought this and originally gave it perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not after less than days it quit charging and quit working called amazon who offered refund when purchased it it was they told me they would refund me and then could order new one and now they are when it worked it works great but it just did not last long on amazon did not really do any favors with replacing sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over asked for replacement and they told me no they gave me refund and told me to re order so that they instead so sure they can make more money not happy and very impressed do not recommend buying the speaker through amazon because amazon seems to be the happy one here go buy it at costo who will honor the same price and replace it ,166,5.0

neutral,this thing is terrific it has shocking amount of bass for small speaker bl pretty much failed the design if were to complain it would be that the base is little narrow use the speaker by my pool and dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool again for you people that are complaining about it being mon its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas do you have to have sterno drivers that will be inches apart is that really needed of course not if that others you there are ton of other devices that might be better fit but doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas have an old it sterno speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the charge going mon delivers more volume longer battery lower heat and simplifies controls bass sucks power this thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers ton of bass stream to it in the backward when swimming in the pool it has really been great it has been accidentally kicked into the pool few times but no damage and it has prove to be water resistant as advertised ,203,5.0

positive,if you are buying this most probably you have done your research and for me it lives up to its expectation the speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill large room if you want to use it outdoor it will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you re having party it gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around is when there is sound distortion great for movie night in bed and for listening to music having owned the lip twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging but wish it had strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and wish it had microphone sometimes but also understand why they didn include it on here ,131,5.0

positive,lui this speaker was disappointed when received it cause it looked small and thought how such speaker of this size could satisfy me but then hooked it up and now download an equalizer pp from the goose store and now have full control on my listening pleasures and great sounds can control the sounds thou my tablet the speaker itself and the equalizer pp all three have volume control truly not sorry bought this speaker take it with me hook it up in the trunk of my car and the sound just resonates with the truck door open the enclosure of the car trunk makes the sound incredible great buy ,110,2.0

positive,i am blown away at how poor this product truly is at first thought it didn work at all because there was no sound but apparently half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked once getting the product working turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music had to download an equalizer pp just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle took it to work the next day with full charge and went to use it and again no sound turned it off and took it home still with full battery went to try it again few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off overall am impressed with not one thing about this speaker and you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product have better success buying one from the dollar store do not buy ,165,2.0

neutral,the user guide and charge cable did not come it was supposed to ,13,3.0
neutral,like everything about it,4,5.0
positive,let me start with what everyone is most interested in these have great sound quality for the size they have better bass than you expect but the treble could be little stronger ve turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well you can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material bought so could output in sterno it bit quickly trying to get them into sterno mode but it does work however for some reason they pitch occasionally which causes dropout when playing in sterno think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers hoping they can come up with firmware update to fix it don have this problem when just using speaker all in all would recommend buying these ,136,1.0
neutral,gift for grandson,3,5.0

positive,i bought this for our wresting room which is very large and this just isn quite big enough for that do however like the sound and feel it is very good speaker just know that it isn for large area ,40,1.0
positive,this is great speaker light and easy to work basic controls that get the job done with no confusion ordered carry strap for it from amazon as well must get the carry strap for hanging and protection gave it out of for sound quality it delivers more bass than treble great speaker for the money claims to have he battery based on use and is waterproof can touch that plenty loud for the beach or backward,76,2.0
positive,this speaker is awesome was bit skeptically about the passive radiations but was impressed it doesn pump bass as much as wired speaker such as echo plus but the sound is still excellent and the battery life is great usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week gave it stars due to the poor us implementation the speaker charges through its us port however it is only able to output power to act like powerbank and charge phone for example through its us port my recommendation to bl is to ditch the us port entirely and use the us port for charging and power output ,112,5.0
positive,love this thing sounds great good bass for small unit very satisfied ,12,5.0
positive,i bought refurbished one but it looked brand new and untouched so saved few bucks and that was good the green color is cool much cooper than black which was my second more expensive choice it connected immediately almost to my pad phone malbrook the sound is great it very loud but don play it that loud yet bought it to use outdoor for music so expect it will work well haired with an phone it simple compact device but it delivers great sound could not be happier and it waterproof which hope never to test but it nice to know because it will be outside and might get left outdoor overnight on occasion battery life seems fine so far but have only used it for few hours time will tell on that one ,134,1.0

positive,this was anaemic lockdown buy my wife and were spending lot of time outside on our ratio our happy hours were missing something great sounds this speaker delivers great sound at low mid and high range it can also play very loud although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors would recommend this speaker to friend ,61,4.0
positive,i ve had this speaker for well over year now use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the ratio ve had it connected to my smaller to that move between porch and ratio but my sonya works better for that due to the sonya pp to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the bl pp it still looks and works as good as when first got it battery lasts good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size especially if its placed against wall or better yet in an inside corner have been very happy with its quality and performance now some negative aspects the battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out the base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off table if bumped speakers are on the ends so you can stand it up vertical it does make loud melody sound when turned off it is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of case adds no value is just another useless item fluttering your life and is environmental negative suggest getting one without the case the current price is much much more percent more than when purchased it maybe due to could price going or just rampart inflation never buy used product that requires built in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new ,275,5.0

positive,practically all bluetooth speakers are mon it has nothing to do with how many drivers speakers bones it has to get sterno sound you usually need to have two of the same or typically at least the same brand bluetooth speaker and send different audit right or left to each one the charge had two forward facing mid high range drivers driven by same signal so they effectively acted as one driver speaker charge replaced the two forward facing drivers with single larger higher quality forward facing driver that produces better depth and definition at least in my opinion ll take the charge over the charge or the lip any day ,111,5.0

positive,i use this product all day and the battery only gets down to half it sounds great and is easy to use ,22,5.0
positive,first of all the speaker is monaural and you need two to get sterno that then you need an pp to convince the speakers to play in sterno and there is no pp for windows or mac only mobile devices tried an andros emulation but you can get to bluetooth that way so forget it the pp is happy too it takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in sterno and the pp has to be left running after while something times out the sound revert to monaural and the pp has to be closed and re started to make it sterno again the only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don care about sterno sound what waste so good sound or not these are going back both of them ,143,5.0

positive,bl as you know prices itself on high quality sound this company far exceeds anyone expectations when it comes to great sounding audit and solid build quality the bl charge is very rugged and tough water proof speaker that really delivers on high quality sound this portable speaker is great for any party no matter the type and it works great with any gene of music when purchased this speaker already knew what was getting because had heard this speaker inside church where they had of them going all connected together and quite frankly they sounded like very expensive sound system and due to the wide expanse of the church sanctuary the bass resented very well from the music and all the miss and high were also there there isn bit of speaker hiss or distortion from these speakers no matter how many are connected oh let me tell you about sterno mode now that is really sweet bl really knew what they were doing when they implements sterno mode for these speakers because let me tell you the sterno mode makes the music quite emerssive and realistic bl sound signature is great and it definitely deserves star reward for excellence and quality the fact that you can connect of these together means that you can have sound all around you if you like believe me you ll be amazed at the bass that these little guns put out and the great sterno mode when connecting two of them together listen to all genius of music but my favorites are ed house and trance as well as country and soft rock ed music really banks on these you will have your own version of the clubs when you use these speakers other genius of music sound great on them as well thanks to bl signature sound which is extremely clear and detailed without any distortion whatsoever and since today music is all digital you need that kind of sound because nothing else will do the bl charge speakers are definitely star in my book and urge everybody to get pair or of them if you can afford it hata as far as comparison between other similar speakers these put bone to shame matter of fact they blow bone clear out of the water bone ain got nothing on these speakers guaranteed now sonya is good runner up but sonya has small problem with sounding little muffled in my opinion actually own the bl boombox and that monster really cranks out the bass and it is very loud the charge speakers are also very loud too for their size which is why am so impressed with them also love the fact that they have an ix rating which means that you can put them in the water yes you can use these speakers in your shower you could take shower in sterno yep totally water proof sterno now isn that something hey if you had smart phone that was also water proof the entire sterno system could go in the shower with you hata mmm new adult pool toy your water proof sterno so if were you would get these bad boys today and let the party begin ,537,1.0

positive,what can say this is hands down the best waterproof portable bluetooth speaker ve ever owned and ve had few bl has household name for reason and rightly so the sound is amazing especially the bass great range and even better battery life the fact that you can charge your device from it is awesome but the link feature has to be my favorite aspect link with your friends who have the same family of speakers with one button for multi source audit ve got few friends with them and it always enhanced the experience also more than one device can pair simultaneously which is super neat highly recommended ,109,5.0

positive,excellent music box for both sound quality and product quality nice looking too easy to carry around ,17,3.0
positive,very fine bluetooth speaker once again bl build quality product ,10,4.0
neutral,the aux on the bl charge is poorly designed the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is delay extended silence or short period of low volume section causing parts of the song to missed for few seconds while it tries to turn back on this creates interruption if you are trying to listen to you or meditative music or podcasts have two of them with the latest firmware and they both have this issue it appears many others have already commented on this issue apparently this was an intentional design by bl to save power but it defeats the purpose of the aux port the bluetooth range and party range is mediocre you can leave the room with your phone or it will cut out ,129,2.0
positive,its great good sound quality and style ,7,1.0

positive,i have had the bl charge for while the sound is good and what you would expect from portable waterproof battery lowered bluetooth speaker anyone who expects studio quality sound from the aforementioned probably truly believes the president they voted for in is as great as he thinks he is however there is one flaw in the charge that no matter the sound quality or anything else will end the usefulness of this device the charging port for the charge is type and if you don get the cable in the port perfectly every time it becomes damaged to the point of being useless you are then left with pounds of useless june bl for this type of product how about more substantial charging port bow what will you give me for les of june ,135,5.0

negative,i have never dropped it or damaged it in any way it barely leaves its shelf never listen on full volume yet the quality turned to absolute propos within the past year noticed it actually after months and it been getting worse the high and miss sound soon muddled and it hurts my ears because listen to rock metal electronic ed and others which are heavy on the percussion and need really good quality sound or it can be heavy on the ears literally appalled going to try to get it fixed by bl hopefully they ll pull through and fix it because really sad and can return it anymore ah ,111,5.0

positive,i live in the country and host or go to lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings we discovered while ago that having radio wasn good enough between lack of music selection and constant commercial the bl charge is perfect party speaker solution and going to leave my impressions based on that use the speaker is plenty loud if you re on deck ratio and it placed several feet away you ll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation it doesn do as well at our large outdoor fire pit because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in that space is about feet from bench on one side of the fire pit to the other and in an open yard the speaker is still good just not great if you like loud commanding music as do if there is larger group of people like speaking at once for example it will not be able to overtake their voices and will be reduced to background music it will also be affected by big bonfire the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire the sound clarity is good bass is nothing crazy but tight and does not distort or sound hollow as noted earlier volume really depends on how small space you re using it in and how many people are talking but even in the big open outdoor area it perfectly loud with only few people most importantly when turned all the way up it maintains clear clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems speakers do when you push them see some complaints about it being mon speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is if want unparalleled sound e customization and other features ll buy true audiophile equipment bluetooth is easy to connect and lifesaver technology in general if you have telephone with enough bars and this speaker you can play as much music as you want bluetooth will stay connected at good distance ve walked about feet from the speaker and had no issues not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker imagine but it will tolerate reasonable distance charge time is definitely optimistic it advertised as being hours but ve not gotten close to that fully charged and playing continuously at full volume connected via bluetooth ve squeezed probably hours out of it which is still plenty often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music the speaker is definitely waterproof ve left it outside in the rain couple of times also let it sit on plastic chair with recess on the bottom it raised overnight and came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in puddles of water where it had sat for hours lowered right up with no issues glad tested its abilities but hate to abuse neglect any of my stuff like that if you re doing something similar to me gathering several friends around chimney on the ratio or sitting out back by the fire pit this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cracked up if you re looking to entertain large group of people who are going to be noisy it not the best choice but who really listening at that point anyway ,571,1.0

positive,this is very good little system for the price holds charge for long time and sounds really good at reasonable volume,21,4.0
positive,i bought like new speaker but before made my purchase contracted the seller and basically asked why the product was classified as like new their response item is inspected and functional there day return period took chance the only reason didn give star rating is because my speaker arrived very poorly packed consider myself lucky the speaker is of such superior quality disability because delivery people don make habit of handling packages carefully and the protection provided amounted to some shrouded foam from an original box thrown in regular shipping box with the packing bubble wrap everything had shifted in shipping there was no effort to secure the bits of packing material to protect the unit and it arrived with no user manual or operating instructions of any kind had to go on couture for tutoring and to bl site for manual download so stars for the product itself actually give the shipper stars but don want the overall rating to reflect poorly on the product itself bl is the truth ,171,5.0
positive,powerful speaker great sound,4,5.0
neutral,doesn hold charge lasted however long the battery was charged for initially and that was it ,16,1.0

positive,in my opinion if you dive too deep into couture reviews regarding decided comparisons etc etc you ll never end up buying any speaker keeping it simple can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it price range take it to the community pool by outdoor family events and it perfect long lasting battery good bluetooth conductivity and packs pretty good punch in both volume and bass would maybe consider the larger bl extreme if it goes on sale but in all honesty this charge is perfect for what use it for probability to me is more important that little higher volume and bass love the speaker well done bl ,112,5.0
negative,i ve had my speaker for about months now the cord got really missed up and stopped charging the speaker and it would take days to get it to of the charging bubbles fully had it charging the whole day and it only got to bubble icon fully ,48,5.0

neutral,can pair any device because the bluetooth button is not working ,11,5.0
positive,this is great speaker with great battery life and great bluetooth conductivity to our samson and chromebook and the bl pp does firmware updated over bluetooth love it the reason for losing one star is its charging behavior bought this to have it in one location constantly connected to charge and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery for some reason the speaker charges fully the less indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it fully charged but then after some time the less turn on again and the th led starts blinking to indicate that it charging and stays that way all this while the speaker sits there connected to the charge without being turned on the less are very bright which makes it more annoying ,134,4.0

positive,i generally don give five stars unless it something extremely love but this little bar of sound is totally awesome amazing extremely worth the money this tiny little bluetooth speaker is amazing it super small but the sound is pretty loud it very portable and you don have to constantly be charging it even at max volume we have two big sonya speakers that can light up party they re also tireless but they re extremely heavy and take up lot of space and they are way too loud for public reunion so we decided to get this bl portable speaker and it was the best thing we did it portable because we could take it camping to the beach or pool or lake and the sound is great and even if you drop it in water or juice it continues to work amazingly ,144,5.0
neutral,bought for my son as present it fit the bill and was actually more than he expected did price comparison and it beat the competition hands down ,27,5.0

neutral,several years ago purchased pair of bl charge speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool the range was great the sound was great and the batteries lasted long time we eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with pair of able latest charge speakers the charge the sound quality and other features are the same but the inability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and link feature are so bad they are unable have to have my phone within feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect and they constantly cut out loose their connection to each other or pick up static it is so persistent we are not using them anymore deeply regret buying these speakers and wish would have spent less money to but the far superior charge speakers again if you plan to connect two or more speakers together stay away from these because they just don work ,179,5.0
positive,this is great device easy to set and use right out of the box excellent sound am using it outside as work on big construction project makes the work go much easier ,32,1.0
positive,great speaker provides good sound and lasts long time the reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn last as long as advertised took it on float trip and it died about hours in granted had it turned up max the entire time and it was hot day but think it should have lasted longer also the sound on the float wasn as loud as would have liked it was incredibly sturdy and portable no complaints there ,79,3.0

positive,i have lip and this charge give played both and in little disappointed with the charge my lip has sterno speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge its weird the lip sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume where the charge doesn sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sitting lip the only thing consider the charge to have over the lip is it doesn get too distorted at max volume like the lip but the lip just sounds great almost at any level but at max maybe little less bass on the lip too but not by much in beginning to regret my charge purchase wish just went with new lip and see how that works out bow used the charge for hotel room bluetooth sounder since live in hotels while working each month so good sound means lot to me especially when get noise complaints from the host ,175,5.0

positive,whereas on the charge the bass gets bit overwhelming on the charge the bass feels non distant by comparison further sound on the charge is less clear than on the charge details in your music get off faint notes disappear although the bass on the charge could be overwhelming the overall sound quality was much better further the charge is heavier bulkier than the charge despite less functionality on the charge could make phone calls but there is no calling ability on the charge if the charge upgrade its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices would trash the charge and go back to the charge the only improvement on the charge over the charge is that the power button is bit easier to press ,127,4.0

positive,i got this speaker to upgrade from my old he boom well would say the only things it does better is battery life and little more volume when you turn the bl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the high and the speaker is very direction so it very difficult to find location for the speaker that doesn turn it into shrill little squeaky box the he have is much smaller speaker but it has nearly degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles all in all the bl definitely wasn worth the money sticking with he ,108,5.0

positive,i originally heard this thing at christmas someone else got one as gift listening to them test it out it put out some amazing sound from such small device it does sound great but there are technical stitches that are really irritating the first second of sound cuts out until it wakes up from its bluetooth soft sleep like state guessing it to save battery life it supposed to have an pp to tailor all kinds of controls but after installing it it refused to recognize the speaker no matter what did it haired fine can play music to it from my phone but communication with the pp hope little bit of user tormented testing would ve gone long way here ,121,5.0

positive,amazing sound play it from the kitchen and can hear it in the bathroom light weight very portable,18,5.0
positive,i purchased this speaker over other portable option specifically because it had an aux input when using this input the speaker has the brilliant design of shutting off when the signal falls below certain threshold this threshold is very high and the the shut off happens basically immediately the result is continuous stuttering of whatever you re listening to which is absolutely unbearable searching online many people experience this some are able to solve it by cracking up the volume all the way up this didn work for me apparently you can remove resist on the circuit board to disabled this built in feature but just returned my unit instead bl was useless when it came to customer support won be purchasing any products from them in the future and don recommend you do either ,135,5.0
positive,after having the bl lip for several years and loving it decided to upgrade and purchase the bl charge bought it new and once it came in tested it out however the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratch even at volume am not sure if this is an issue with the bl charge or the individual speaker received either way will be returning this product and am very disappointed ,82,5.0

positive,the speaker connected to my phone right away however it was very difficult to connect it to area and it didn work very smoothly had to go into the pp to recollect every time wanted to use it the main problem however is that it wouldn connect at all to the bl pp contracted customer service and they suggested resecting the speaker and explained how to do this followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off success except not so much now the speaker won turn on at all hoping this is just defective device and when return it and receive my new one it will work much better if so will rate it again in more positive light added note once again was able to contact bl customer service and they got the device working again it works perfectly except it still won connect to the bl pp after reading reviews of the pp this is clearly failure of the pp not the speaker love the speaker gave instead of only because of the problem with the bl pp ,189,5.0

negative,maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting if you hold it in front of you you can immediately notice that there no sound coming from the left side initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mon did more research and learned it was designed that way the sound quality is still excellent just personally can look past the unequal sound distribution ,75,5.0

positive,i bought second speaker to have it in sterno but notice while having it that the other speaker cut off few seconds other then that it feels like brand new speaker if want true sterno need to by splitter and connect both as normal speakers for my lawton plus the singing with couture is pretty bad with video it sounds clear and loud oh and one last thing about in sterno mode on and phone it works with one pp at time so use it on couture for one day with the bl connect and then use it with goose music another day when you son the sterno mode with the audit pp you that you want to use it on windows its basically party mode and no real sterno mode did this with my lawton and one speaker son in and the other son in bit slower of seconds to son in this is why give it stars but over all can charge my phone or use each one as speaker louder then my phone can use it as goose or area voice activate or even sir but as two speakers in sterno is good on is on my phone but can do it on windows ,207,5.0

neutral,phenomena,1,5.0
positive,i ve tried other bl bluetooth speakers in past years to be clear ve tried many dozens listened for hours tested usually reviewed and ve kept the ones that think have something special good sound thought after few more generations bl may have figured out how to nail together decent thing was wrong buy bone sounding mind listen to it figure out how to do better than that it has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger better bl don cry bone also completely seemed it with their own new generation revolve speakers they had spectacular speakers in the sounding iii and especially the brilliant and nonpareil sounding mind and decided to make the awful revolve speakers they may get notch louder and sound like muddy garage but it round and that makes it better for parties congratulations we ve discovered idiocracy sonya is even worse leading the charge into irrelevant starting with the mrs and improving it by making the mrs x great bass for speaker its size if only great sound was produced by bass alone it doesn produce any midranges or treble speakers by idiot for idiot anyway bl has never made great bluetooth speaker so suppose th generation speaker that still sucks isn really giving anything up just want the world to know that this speaker just ain great there better richer more articulate deep and mid bass in the bone sounding mind at half the size it not waterproof and suppose people who need speakers with round cabinet probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time and can figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in so maybe the bl is great for certain type of person ,294,5.0

positive,love the sound quality really happy with this purchase there enough evidence and reviews on couture to show how good these speakers are ,23,5.0
positive,i had high expectations for the bl charge because it has lot of competition and gets good reviews it not exactly cheap either this implies that the charge should be optimistically almost as good as bone for example unfortunately not call me ironically spoiled use omaha he and he monitor on isolation stands at home my truck has bone system that delivers bass miss and high like reference system ve heard plenty of bone bluetooth speakers and they ve sounded good used to hearing everything crisp and clear having said all of that many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality it not terrible and it actually sounds good in sterno with two connected together unfortunately it not that simple sterno mode is very reliable and only with single charge the high and miss sound pretty appealing the best word can think of to describe its overall sound is flat and floppy with punch bass the sound stage is disappointing one dimensions unless you buy second one and use bl bl connect pp to run them in sterno sterno mode gives these charge an instant drastic improvement in sound but my speakers switch out of sterno mode and into party mode dual mon every time switch between apes and sometimes just from hitting pause for second this should have never made it past a at bl didn know that was happening at first but did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible even with two connected that party mode it two copies of the same sounds right on top of each other don want that want left and right speakers that work reliable sterno mode gives wide sterno image and somehow balances out the lone charge inadequacies bit but can even count on it to work properly to summarize think the charge has potential to make good quality bluetooth audit solution but only if you plan on buying two and only if bl improves sterno mode functionality right away the pp should remember which mode the speakers were on and keep it that way or let us choose default mode either would help tremendous ,362,4.0

positive,i purchased one of these about months ago for regular use found the sound quality to be very good owned an older bl speaker that failed within months the warranty return was haste so am pleased that this model has performed well prefer that tactile buttons as it makes it easier to find buttons in dark situation as well as while driving also like the us connection the older bl with micro us port failed from wear and tear can no longer charge that one and repairing it is not cost effective the only desert can say is this unit is bit heavy to carry around and listen to music it more for placing in static location do want to note the sound does tend to come from one side of the unit it not it also isn sterno speaker that means one driver with channels merged not important for me the phone pp allows for creating sterno sound from individual units verified that purchased nd unit during the holiday sale and would recommend this speaker to good friend ,179,5.0

negative,i returned the bl charge for two reason first to my ears the sound has too much bottom music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass unfortunately there no way to adjust the bass and treble what you hear is what you re stuck with the second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud and completely unnecessary ,87,1.0
positive,excellent speaker with great sound quality would recommend to someone who is looking for mid sized portable bluetooth speaker,19,4.0

positive,prior to this had bl lip for few years before it finally died decided to go for this charge rather than another lip since wanted little more volume out in the garage this charge has surpassed my expectations it significantly louder than the lip but never loses clarity even at high volumes the audit is clean and bass is very good as well the biggest surprise has been the battery life feel like the speaker gets used constantly but it only needs to be charged once week or so it also waterproof which makes it super easy to clean all in all couldn be happier ,105,5.0

neutral,upon opening this speaker noticed it comes in very nice box the speaker seems unable and sounds amazing when it works right only had this for days used it the st day worked great come the rd day not so much it will play but cut out intermittently during songs speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to figure got lemon so ll try another might suggest don bother talking with support they will drive you insane just replace and move on ,91,5.0
negative,i would be as gathered by the fact the charge switched to mon if they would ve at least centered the damn speaker blows my mind the majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that no way would pay full price for the charge when the is sterno much cheaper and likely sounds better ,62,5.0

negative,i bought this because wanted portable speaker with an old fashioned aux input unfortunately the aux input has horrible flaw if couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you re listening too the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again you ll lose about half second of audit as it turns on again too like let say you re listening to an album couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you ll lose the first little bit of the following song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens so so annoying after little internet sloughing found out that this is just how they are apparently you can fix it by shouting chip on the motherboard but not doing that returning it rip bl really dumb ,152,5.0

positive,initially my preference was the bone sounding mind ii with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in small transportable package that is until heard comparison against bl charge on couture based on that review and others purchased this speaker for its waterproof multi connect and sound great price you can buy charge direct from bl for with color option with price point being on par with amazon sounds great excellent better describes it if you have charge there isn enough improvement to justify buying charge the charge went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from he to deeper he when the bl arrived we conducted our own comparison against bone sounding mind ii and now the charge is much clearer has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room it bit larger and heavier than the sounding mind ii which might turn some off but to me if going to carry any speaker like this then taking the same care and am sure can find just little more room good packing but no instructions not that charging and set are all that difficult but this is my first device that requires us first anything that arrived with zero printed information and rechargeable device that arrived with zero anything to charge it with set was easy bought us cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for hours since it came somewhat charged already once charged press the bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device for settings always recommend phone volume to be no more than to volume then using the charge volume from there this affords you plenty of up down volume adjustment remote from your phone and doesn task the internal sound processor this since it cheaper to replace repair charge than an expensive smartphone you and someone else can be bluetooth haired to this speaker at the same time battery life the built in rechargeable li ion may battery is strong not only does it support up to hours of pastime at lowest setting and figure hours at half volume but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the us port strongly suggest buying protective case for it which will hold your charge us charging cable and any spare us cable needed for cell phone it has the same ix waterproof as phone samson or other higher end smartphone we place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid pills big splashed being left in the rain or even an accidental swim in the pool having that peace of mind alone is priceless bl connect with connect you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience put in opposing corners of large room in different rooms indoor and outdoor neck even in your car if your current sterno or speakers are cap bottom line this being my first bluetooth speaker ever and having friends that have made different choice for the speakers they have have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs bang for buck is spot on have excellent sound in transportable package in tireless speaker that is rugged waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect now proudly own the party favorite speaker for social events and private enjoyment win ,565,5.0

positive,sound quality is absolutely great for its size it can really fill space sometimes leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like have whole mind hi i sterno system in there the bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right place it in corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed it slightly bigger than the charge but probably the price you pay for bigger sound it really hasn affected the probability for me just throw it in my backpack and go it pretty unable haven dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after day at the beach my only grip is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side so sometimes if you re right in front of the speaker close enough to it you may hear bias towards the left side other than that totally excellent speaker never really charged my phone on it beyond few minutes but it works and the battery life feels super long especially if you re not playing it constantly honestly just excited now waiting to see how bl is going to improve on this in future models ,233,5.0

positive,great product great sound,4,5.0
negative,although just yesterday ordered the bl charge and so haven received it yet did some research into how the device charges on one end of the charging cable is the new and better type of us connection us and on the other the standard well familiar us connection the charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of us connection known as us not the standard us that we are well familiar with however the unit comes supplied with sided cable that will plug into standard us port such as on most or all home and office computers and also some ac wall charges the speaker does not come with this necessary us accepting ac wall charge so if you do not have one already you have to buy one someplace otherwise simply plug it into us port on computer the new type of us connection us is better because it is the same all around that is you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting it ll work no matter which way you plug it in much convenient design over the old think but am not sure that it might also work faster than the old and familiar us connection however at least as of now there is still standard us connection on the other end of the cable so perhaps the faster charging speed assuming even correct on this might only be the case when these tables have the new type of us us connections on both ends in any case as is it still better than the standard us because of not having to humble around when attempting to plug it in not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old standard us connections the fumbling can actually damage the inside of us port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connection like trying to force square peg into round hole after while the inner of the port will get bent out of shape however this is much more of problem with the standard mind us connections commonly used with mobile phone and many other small devices ,363,5.0

positive,update definitely noticeable sound differences between the speakers the model is flatter and doesn get as loud as the model it also has muffled sound to it so far have received bad customer service from bl the seller bought from electronics exit an authorized dealer has week return policy so outside of that and thus far bl won even admit they are selling different models to customers sent pictures and even links to for filing pages and the customer service rep don even acknowledge it they want me to do factory rests and firmware updated it different hardware all they offered me was some coupon and told me to deal with the seller this is the last time ll ever purchase bl product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well original pictures included just so people are aware there are different models of the actual speaker you may get with this it seems legitimate based on the for filing page but want people to understand in case they notice differences like did when put them side by side the model number on the box itself is the same jblchargeblkam but bl is shipping different speakers inside the box and not telling people there is model and model the boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small or code next to the aerial number on the model if you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the aerial number you will see which one you have now if you only order one speaker you probably never know but if you order of them and receive different models the differences are obvious charges the looks to be the older model according to for filing this has may battery inside from my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all it also feels bit heavier in the hand don have digital scale to measure exactly but it definitely more dense the charging indicator lights are also much brighter you can see this in the pictures charge the seems to be the newer model this is the model that actually has may battery inside the mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside also the charging lights on this model are much dimmler compared to the it feels bit lighter in the hand as well haven put them through the finger yet to see if there are audit differences it would be very disappointing if there are so buyer beware bl is selling different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different but they are marketing it as the same product wish would have known this before bought them ,467,5.0

neutral,nice speaker,2,5.0
positive,i purchased the bl charge because of reviews had also purchased he megaboom not the newer megaboom the two were equally prices so it came down to sound and features the bl allows for charging device and for using plug in direct jack instead of bluetooth thought those were more important when ordered it until listened to them side by side had listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs the other listeners liked the megaboom better but couldn identify why found the megaboom to have tighter bass and much better transparent miss and high the charge sounded muddy in lows miss high in comparison alone it can sound okay as long as you don have competitive reference sound quality beat out battery charging and the aux input ,131,5.0
positive,as woman in today society it is hard to find the time to clean and cook but now having speaker that plays my audit of choice it definitely helps to motivate those actions can wait to clean next saturday this is awesome it can go any where with you and is water resistant hello shower concerts simply hook up your bluetooth device to the speaker and your ready ,68,5.0

positive,i upgrade from bl lip that couldn hold charge after about years was resistant about buying speaker that has only driver but so far have zero complaints run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges give it it has huge battery that will certainly last you for hours have currently used it for roughly hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near full charge only time will tell another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same bl connect feature other workers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into party would highly recommend this speaker if you re looking for something that puts out high volume and has great battery life ,145,3.0

positive,i have been musician my entire life and this thing sounds like utter garage compared similar bl speakers the one speaker is just horrible go to store and try for yourself even the old link is better sounding ,38,5.0
positive,the bl charge is great product found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature have found that the high aren totally accurate but they re close enough to not distract you from the music the high are present but definitely aren strong which adds to the warm signature the miss are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device because of this the vocal are great in most songs they are well represented unless they speak up on the high notes which is when you can hear slight distortion from accuracy however the vocal which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiations making it sound bass and realistic if you listen to high quality his tracks you ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage as for the mon speaker don listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don know what they re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don like the thought of it you re not going to get sterno by using speakers inches apart like on the last model and as for separation this mon speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows the speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamic all the way to just under full volume ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge x x x extreme onya and what ve found is that while the high are bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments the bass is very good in the charge the bass notes are represented accurately and it able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can however it worth mentioning it still no sub this speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies the radiations start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don know this doesn sound very good the battery life of this speaker wasn as advertised and found could only get hours on percent volume which isn bad but is huge deviation from the claimed hours after using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers ve actually grown fond of this unit and it become my beach toy don take any critics in this review too seriously as doubt most people are as critical as me when it comes to audit but this one gets my thumbs up future improvements would definitely require sweeter and possibly bigger battery ,460,4.0
positive,i never looked into bl before this sound quality is amazing disability is top notch it is sleek and not to bulky have not tested out the waterproof part but think leave that for another time the battery lasts very long time like it says his it also great back portable charge for my phone kind wish got the bigger one just because really liked this brand this is me saying this not someone telling me to say it but if you like protecting your things would also get the carrying case will unload picture at another time ,98,5.0

neutral,i had intended on buying megaboom but got to test out this speaker along with boom and megaboom and the fullness of sound in particular the quality of the bass on this thing blew those two out of the water the non universal charge cord is little annoying but oh well don expect to get sub bass out of this thing it would have to be about inches taller for that ,71,5.0

positive,update from stars to was having trouble with the bl connect pp but now got it figured out do not have more than connected devices at one time otherwise the pp will not work once the pp worked could now turn off the audit prompt which was annoying when especially you don want to disturb anyone now the start up and volume either reached maximum or minimum does not give me the unwanted feedback nice note my experience with this speaker was less than his also it didn been through water test just so you guns know only single sound driver could tell sound was coming from more from the right side when had the speaker feet away from me and that my preferred use that was already little unpleasant next issue was the bl connect pp didn work at all it couldn find the speaker what lastly and most importantly used my speaker lot listening to audit book before go to bed when this speaker volume was down to say maybe or so could hear random breaking up background noise coming off it that was my last draw and unfortunately had to return it what would like to is that the light indicator can be controlled via the pp but since couldn use the pp wasn sure if the light indicator could be off or dim somehow it is way too bright and unnecessary also if possible led indicator to show the level of the current volume it does not have to permanently turned on but fade away after second or two that will be way better bl bl oh no ,272,5.0
