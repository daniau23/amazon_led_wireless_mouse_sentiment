1. Based on the predictions of XGB classifier, I will be making use of Xgb classifier with a vector size of 25 because it is less heavy than the vectorsize of 200.
2. Again readjustment to the parameters used in the classifier or to the stop words will in fact improve performance.
3. But I do believe a deep learning model will outperform these models.
